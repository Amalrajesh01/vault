      You can never predict what happens after you start a business. Long-term plans and detailed documents are pointless. 
      Most businesses go on to do something very different from what they set out to do. Today, this is called a pivot.
  
      “A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” Eric Ries
  
      A startup is a bit more exciting. It has:
      1. High impact potential.
      2. High levels of innovation.
      3. High levels of uncertainty
  
      I want you to think about launching a startup instead of a business. Anyone can create a job for themselves.
       But not everyone can change the world
  
      With high impact potential and high levels of innovation, a startup has the ability to change the world.
  
      Work on your business, not in your business—impossible and impractical when you are bootstrapping a new idea.
       Optimize your funnel—pointless when you have no leads. Hack your growth—difficult before you have customers.
  
      Execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world
  
      Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time
  
      Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers.
       That could mean “getting out of the building” for some. For you, your skillset, your customers, and your business, it might mean something totally different.
  
      “Move fast and break things.” Mark Zuckerberg
  
      Before you start a task, your brain visualizes the hardest parts to come. It then tries to simulate real work by focusing on small mindless tasks.
       In other words, you spend hours and days fussing over logos and website copy instead of selling your product
  
      A wantrepreneur is someone who wants to be an entrepreneur, but is so obsessed with watching TED talks and talking about their business ideas that they never launch them
  
      If you have a conversation with a friend about your business idea this month, and next month you are having the same conversation, you are a wantrepreneur
  
      “The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before.” Neil Gaiman
  
      1. The Idea Matters - A bad idea, executed well, will not make a good business.
      2. Execution Matters - A good idea, executed poorly, will not make a good business.
      3. A Founder’s Ability to Get Customers (To Hustle) Matters - A great idea, executed well, will fail without customers.
      4. Timing Matters - Speaking hypothetically about an idea is pointless if the timing is wrong.
      5. Luck Matters - In fact, it matters much more than most entrepreneurs would care to admit.
  
      It makes no sense to start a business that is going to have you doing work you don’t enjoy. If you don’t like what you see, then 
      it’s not a good business idea for you. Other than that, don’t worry about passion.
  
      Startup founders should have the ambition to grow their business into a larger company. If you don’t have that ambition, what you are creating is not a startup.
  
      Focusing on short-term launches or projects won’t build assets. Assets are built over time by ignoring short-term distractions in favor of a bigger, longterm vision.
  
      A list of customers that pay you every month is an asset. If you focus on shortterm projects you’ll make more money initially.
     But if you turn down projects and focus on providing recurring value, you build a valuable asset. Your product design and intellectual property are assets.
     If you resell or copy someone else’s product, you might have better margins in the short term; but creating your own gives you a long-term asset.
     Your team is an asset. If you hire mediocre people to save money, you get more money in the short term. If you hire great people,
      you are building a valuable asset that grows your business.
  
      Creating a startup means creating something valuable for your customers that is a long-term asset.
       It doesn’t mean going after low-hanging fruit, getting caught up in get rich quick schemes, or chasing passive income 
       fundamentally entrepreneurship is about creating a product that people want and selling it to them.
  
      “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them,” is correct. Everyone might be saying that your idea is great,
       but look at whether or not they are currently paying for a solution to the same problem.
  
      Write down exactly what you will launch on Day 7. What will your customers get, what is included, and what is excluded? 
      If necessary, write down what is automated and what will be done manually in the short term.
  
      Day 1 Task - Brainstorm a bunch of ideas and evaluate them against the checklist. Choose the idea that stands out as being the best option for you.
       You can use the template provided at wpcurve.com/7daystartup if that helps. Most importantly, keep your name to fewer than 12 characters if possible.
  
      Create in-depth content based around the customer problems that your business solves.
      2. Make content as actionable and useful to your target audience as possible.
      3. It can’t be boring. Don’t just create content around your area of expertise. Create anything that is interesting to your potential customers
  
      Getting press attention for your company can be a huge bonus. If it’s well targeted, it leads to direct customers. 
      Perhaps a bigger benefit is the extra proof and credibility you get as a result
  
      Marketing is really just about getting your message out to qualified people as efficiently as possible.
       Connect your message with them as best you can
  
      Day 5 Task - Build a list of what marketing methods you are going to choose. Put together a rough plan for the first week or two of your launch.
       To make it easier, Save your excitement until you land people you don’t know as customers.
  
      Create a spreadsheet that covers the first few months in business, the number of signups, revenue, estimated costs, and monthly growth
  
      “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Reid Hoffman
  
      Day 7 Task - Launch and start executing your marketing plan.
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      If you have an open mind, you can easily test your assumptions and those assumptions made by others in your industry.
       Why does everyone in your industry do things a certain way? What do your customers really like about your service? Why aren’t people buying your product?
        Why are they buying your product? Are people using your product? How are they using it? Why do they love it?
  
      What do they tell people when they refer you? Are certain parts of your product necessary? Do you need an office? Do you need a business card? Do you need a logo
  
      Being true to your word is a very important part of building trust in business. Whether you are offering services or selling a product,
       make sure you always deliver on what you promise. You can do everything else right, but if you are the guy or girl that promises the world and doesn’t deliver,
        your mistake will be uncovered in the end. Your reputation is everything and it will impact every business you start, not just this one.
         It’s far better to under-promise and over-deliver, or at the very least deliver exactly what you promise every time.
  
      Don’t debate every last issue internally until you are blue in the face. Whatever you are discussing can probably be solved by 
      either looking at what other companies have done before you, or implementing a quick decision and learning from the real data. 
      The minute that you are debating could be distracting you from a fundamental problem that you aren’t seeing.
       Always take a step back and ask yourself if it’s feasible that someone else may have solved this problem before
  
      “Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. 
      This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.”
  
      Eric Ries calls it “Build, Measure, Learn.” Michael Masterson calls it “Ready Fire Aim.” I call it “Getting Shit Done.”
  
      Your own personal happiness and motivation are the most important keys to the success of your business.
       I know plenty of people who have created great businesses, taken them to a point, and then lost all motivation.
        If you are struggling with motivation, join a forum, start a mastermind, find a cofounder, hire people to do the hard work, and get back to what you’re good at.
         Take the warning signs seriously. You should be more excited about Monday than you are about Friday. 
         If that’s not the case, there’s a good chance things aren’t going to work out
  
      Difficult customers will waste your time, kill your confidence, and destroy your motivation (and soul).
       No amount of money is worth working with a difficult customer. Every difficult customer can be replaced by a better one, generally much quicker than you think. 
       The work required to replace them is a far better use of your time than any work spent trying to help them
  
      Think in the long term about what asset you are building as a result of actions you complete today.
       Getting carried away on short-term projects will kill any chance of momentum and hurt growth
  
      Running a business can be daunting. Every expert has a different opinion on some “must have” technique or technology you need to be using. 
      It’s hard to know where to spend your time, money, and attention. If you are in doubt, come back to the product. 
      Anything you can do that improves the product or improves the customer experience will be a sound investment.
  
      14. Love Your Work If you don’t, the rest will fall apart. It’s that simple
  
      “The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.” Eric Ries Hopefully I’ve set you on a path to create an exciting and profitable startup.
       The first major hurdle is launching; then, getting your first customer; and then, proving the concept and generating a wage for yourself in a scalable way.
        What happens after all that? Now it’s time to run your business, and your decisions from here out will make or break it in the long term.
         Most businesses don’t survive, so what do you do to keep yours growing?

    title: '10X Rule',
    body: `These concepts of goal setting, target attainment, and taking action are not taught in
    schools,
    
    When people start limiting the amount of success they desire, I assure you they
    will limit what will be required of them in order to achieve success and will fail
    miserably at doing what it takes to keep it.
    
    This is the focus of the 10X Rule: You
    must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times
    what you think it will take to accomplish those targets. Massive thoughts must be
    followed by massive actions. There is nothing ordinary about the 10X Rule. It is
    simply what it says it is: 10 times the thoughts and 10 times the actions of other
    people.
    
    Spending too much time competing and not enough time dominating their
    sector.
    
    A person who limits his or her potential success will limit what he or she
    will do to create it and keep it.
    
    countless banks, companies, and even entire
    industries, failed to appropriately assess the situation
    
    As long as you are alive,
    you will either live to accomplish your own goals and dreams or be used as a resource
    to accomplish someone else’s
    
    Most people’s—including managers’—first response
    is to reduce the target rather than increase their activity.
    
    Never reduce a target.
    Instead, increase actions
    
    the target is never the problem. Any target attacked with
    the right actions in the right amounts with persistence is attainable.
    
    regardless
    of how detailed your business plan is. I don’t care if your product cost nothing to
    make and it’s 100 times superior to its closest competitor; you will still have to
    apply 10 times more effort just to push through all the noise in order to get people
    to even know about it
    
    If you want to save time in getting your idea or product to
    market, then you must make sure you do 10 times more of everything in order to
    be in more places with more people over shorter durations.
    
    success does not merely
    “happen.” It is the result of relentless, proper actions taken over time. Only those
    who operate with the appropriate view and corresponding actions will have success
    
    1. Success is important.
    2. Success is your duty.
    3. There is no shortage of success
    
    You know, you don’t need to grow old to die. I was dying at the age of 20 as a result
    of no direction and no purpose.
    
    luck is just one of the byproducts of those who
    take the most action. The reason why successful people seem lucky is because
    success naturally allows for more success.
    
    “The harder I work, the luckier I get
    
    To get where you want to go in life, you must adopt the view that whatever is going
    on in your world—good, bad, or nothing—is something caused by you
    
    If you are willing
    to take credit when you win,
    
    Increase your responsibility level, assume control for
    everything that happens to you, and live by the slogan that nothing happens to
    you—only because of you! And remember, “Don’t be a little bitch.”
    
    You can also
    expect to be criticized and labeled by others when you start taking massive action.
    The second you start hitting it big, you will immediately be judged by the mediocre.
    People who operate at the other three levels of action will be threatened by your
    activity level and will often make it seem somehow “wrong” in order to make
    themselves right.
    
    No one is going to come to your house and make your dreams come
    true. No one is going to march into your company and make your products known
    to the world. In order to stand out from the crowd—and for customers to even
    consider your products, services, and organization—you must take massive action.
    I
    
    entire companies and industries are being wiped out as a result of average
    products, average management, average workers, average actions, and average
    thinking.
    
    The average worker reads an average of less than one book a year and
    works an average of 37.5 hours per week. This 62 THE 10X RULE same person makes
    319 times less money than the top U.S. CEOs, who claim to read more than 60
    books a year. Many of these financially successful executives are maligned for the
    huge sums of money they receive
    
    Most businesses fail because they are unable to
    sell their ideas, products, and services at prices high enough to sustain the company
    and fund its activities.
    
    Average thinking and actions will only guarantee you misery,
    uncertainty, and failure
    
    Ask yourself whether the goals you have set are equal to your
    potential. Most people will admit that their goals are well below their potential—
    because most of the world has been convinced, persuaded, and even educated
    to set small, attainable, and realistic goals
    
    1. Set 10X targets.
    2. Align them with your other purposes.
    3. Write them down every day—when you wake up and before you go to sleep.
    
    Forward thinkers don’t copy. They don’t compete—they create. They also don’t look
    at what others have done.
    
    Never make it your goal to compete. Instead, do everything you
    can to dominate your sector in order to avoid spending your time chasing someone
    else.
    
    You can’t dominate if you don’t penetrate,
    82 THE 10X RULE and you won’t penetrate by using reasonable levels of activity. Your
    biggest problem is obscurity—other people don’t know you and aren’t thinking
    about you.
    
    Two things will happen when you take the right amount of action: (1) You will
    get a new set of problems and (2) your competition will start promoting you
    
    vLearn
    how to dominate by being first in the minds of your market, your clients, and even
    your competitors. Market conditions won’t improve until you improve the way you
    think and approach the market.
    
    To dominate your sector, your goal, dream, or ambition, you must
    fi rst dominate your every interest, thought, and consideration.
    
    Make your dreams, goals, and mission your mind’s and actions’ dominant concern
    
    I suggest that you become obsessed about the things you want; otherwise, you are
    going to spend a lifetime being obsessed with making up excuses as to why you
    didn’t get the life you wanted.
    
    The most valuable chips you have are your mind-set, actions, persistence, and creativity.
    You can go “all in” with energy as many times as you want—because even if
    you fail, you can keep going all in!
    
    There is no failure unless you
    quit! It is impossible for you to “use up” all of your energy— or creativity. It is impossible
    for you to run out of ideas. You’ll never lose the ability to come up with new
    dreams, have more energy, think creatively, look at a situation or event differently,
    Go “All In” and Overcommit
    
    You may lose the customer, but
    so what? You still have unlimited resources to give it your all
    with the next client. You have everything to gain and nothing
    to lose; you simply have to rethink your approach
    
    Grand claims, overcommitment, and extreme promises will immediately separate
    you from the masses—and therefore force you to deliver at 10X levels.
    
    Most
    companies fail not because they stay on the offensive but because they don’t
    properly prepare themselves for expansion and cannot dominate the sector
    
    you must
    keep adding wood until the fi re is burning so hot that no one—and nothing—can
    put out your successes.
    
    All the excuses in the world won’t change one simple fact: that fear is a sign to
    do whatever it is you fear—and do it quickly.
    
    Eat your fears; don’t feed them by
    backing off or giving them time to grow.
    
    The busier you become, the more you
    have to manage, control, and prioritize
    
    Customer service is the wrong target; increasing
    customers is the right target. This doesn’t mean customer satisfaction isn’t
    important. Everyone knows that customers have to be satisfi ed and happy in order
    for them to return and give positive word of mouth.
    
    Make your primary focus commanding attention and generating customers before
    you worry about making them happy
    
    You can’t keep everyone happy all the
    time. It’s a mistake to be scared of complaints. Instead, encourage them, look for
    them, fi nd them, and then resolve them. Complaints are your customers’ very direct
    way of telling you exactly how to make your product better. If
    
    There are, of course,
    measures 140 THE 10X RULE you can take to improve your product or service.
    But when dealing with human beings, you are going to face complaints and
    dissatisfaction.
    
    Is Starbucks concerned about people standing in line too long and
    getting the right coffee and being greeted?
    
    If you truly want to fi nd out what your
    organization’s customer acquisition and loyalty weaknesses are, then survey the
    people who you do not acquire. The sooner you can ask them questions, the better—ideally, as they leave or refuse the business. And be sure to ask them about the
    processes—not about the people—they encountered. You might ask questions
    like the following:
    How long were you here?
    Did you meet a manager?
    Were you shown optional products?
    Were you presented with a proposal?
    Did anyone offer to bring the product to your home/
    offi ce?
    
    You want people to see you so often that they think of you constantly
    and instantaneously identify your face or name or logo with not just the offering
    you represent but even the offering made by those similar to you.
    
    Rather than
    spending energy on retaliating, I spent all my energy, resources, and creativity on
    becoming omnipresent and expanding my footprint
    
    An “excuse” is a justifi cation for
    doing—or not doing—something.
    
    All powerful companies, ideas, products, and
    people are omnipresent. They can be found everywhere. They dominate their
    sector and become synonymous with that which they represent.
    
    The quality of
    being rare is what makes something valuable. So anything that is plentiful has very
    little worth.
    
    The following list of ways you should act in order to be successful
    
    1. Have a “Can Do” Attitude
    People with a “can do” attitude approach every situation with
    the outlook that no matter what, it can be done. They consistently
    use phrases like “We can do it,” “Let’s make it happen,” “Let’s work it out”—
    and they always maintain that a solution exists
    
    2. Believe That “I Will Figure It Out” 
    it refers to the individual who is always looking to be
    responsible and solve a problem. Even if you’re not sure how
    to do something, the best answer is “I will fi gure it out”—
    
    17. Embrace Change
    
    18. Determine and Take the Right Approach
    
    The right approach may be to institute a public
    relations program that softens the market, provide consumers
    with the right tool, or compel management to make the most
    powerful connections, fi nd the best fi rst investors, or hire
    the highest-quality staff.
    
    9. Break Traditional Ideas
    
    20. Be Goal-Oriented
    
    If you don’t stay
    focused on your goals, you will spend your life achieving the objectives
    of other people—particularly those who are goal-oriented
    
    21. Be on a Mission
    
    Successful employees, employers, entrepreneurs, and market
    Successful or Unsuccessful? 177
    changers consider their daily activities to be part of a more
    important mission that will change things signifi cantly. They
    are always thinking bigger and homing in on some massive
    target to achieve.
    
    22. Have a High Level of Motivation
    
    You can encourage, you
    can challenge, and you can inspire, but true motivation—the
    underlying reason for doing something
    
    23. Be Interested in Results
    
    24. Have Big Goals and Dreams
    
    25. Create Your Own Reality
    
    26. Commit First—Figure Out Later
    
    27. Be Highly Ethical
    
    28. Be Interested in the Group
    
    29. Be Dedicated to Continuous Learning
    
    30. Be Uncomfortable
    
    It feels good when things are familiar.
    However, successful people are willing to put themselves
    in new and unfamiliar situations. That
    
    31. “Reach Up” in Relationships
    
    Yet the average person typically spends his or her
    time with like-minded people
    
    Black belts don’t
    learn new skills from white belts
    
    32. Be Disciplined
    
    None of the things on this list is a superhuman quality.
    Every single one is attainable
    
    You certainly can’t start
    yesterday, and if you wait until tomorrow, you won’t be a success
    because you will have violated an important tenet of the
    successful: Act now and then keep acting with the knowledge
    that enough actions taken now will create the future
    
    1. Do not reduce your goals as you write them.
    2. Do not get lost in the details of how to accomplish them
    at this point.
    3. Ask yourself, “What actions can I take today to move me
    toward these goals?”
    4. Take whatever actions you come up with—regardless of
    what they are or how you feel.
    5. Do not prematurely value the outcome of your actions.
    6. Go back each day and review the list.
    
    Look around you and you will see
    the world filled with average people, average thinking, and—at best—average
    actions.

    What hurts us is not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us. The most important thing is how we RESPOND to what happens to us in our lives. 
    And that is a CHOICE!
    
    Write down at least three changes that you want to make today:
    
    "The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it." - Marcus Aurelius
    
    "You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you." - James Allen
    
    Positive thinking is to see reality as it is, accept it, and make the best of it.
    
    Your thoughts depend on your beliefs about life.
    
    "These then are my last words to you. Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.
    
    If you think that you won't make it, if you think that it's impossible, then you will not achieve it even if your effort is huge.
    
    I create my destiny.
    Nobody can hurt me if I don't allow it.
    Life is great!
    Everything happens for a reason.
    Everything is going to be all right.
    I can do it!
    
    "The optimist sees the donut, the pessimist sees the hole."
    
    "A pessimist is somebody who complains about the noise when opportunity knocks."
    
    "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time."
    
    "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."
    
    "Be willing to be uncomfortable. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. It may get tough, but it's a small price to pay for living a dream." - Peter McWilliams
    
    Have a clear goal and the burning desire to achieve it.
    Make a clear plan and act on it with daily action steps.
    Be immune to all negative and discouraging influences.
    Have a support system of one or more people who will encourage you.
    "How can it be done?" If you ask yourself "how," your brain will search for an answer and come up with it. The good thing is that
     you can really change your life by changing your language, talking to yourself in a positive way, and starting to ask yourself different questions.
    
    Spend the first 15 minutes of your working day prioritizing what to do.
    Spend one hour a week for organizing and filing papers.
    Spend 15 minutes a day throwing away papers and clearing away your desk.
    Spend the last 15 minutes of your working day going through your tasks for tomorrow. What's important? What's urgent?
    
    "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody." - Bill Cosby
    
    "It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom."
    
    It's scientifically proven that 6 hours should be enough sleep per night paired with a 30 to 60-minute power nap in the afternoon. 
    Your freshness depends on the quality of your sleep, not on the quantity.
    
    You have to try and figure out for yourself how many hours of sleep you need to feel refreshed. But you should definitely give it a try.
     It will improve your quality of life a lot. Don't forget that getting up early is a new habit, so give it some time and don't give up after 
     the first week if you still feel tired after getting up earlier. The habit needs at least 3 to 4 weeks to kick in.
    
    In the end, getting up or hitting the snooze button is a decision you make. It's up to you. How important is a better lifestyle and more time for you?
    
    "It's choice – not chance – that determines your destiny."
    
    "The fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself." - Paolo Coelho
    
    "You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do." - Eleanor Roosevelt
    
    "Great things are done by a series of small things brought together." - Vincent van Gogh
    
    "It isn't the mountains ahead that wear you out. It's the grain of sand in your shoe." - Robert Service
    
    "Bottom line is, if you do not use it or need it, it's clutter, and it needs to go." - Charisse Ward
    
    "Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year."
    
    Think positive: Today is going to be a great day!
    Remember for 5 minutes what you are grateful for.
    15 minutes of quiet time.
    Imagine the day that is about to start going very well.
    Watch a sunrise.
    Go running or take a walk.
    Write in your journal.
    
    The last half an hour of your day has the same importance! The things you do in the last half an hour before sleeping will remain in your subconscious during your sleep. 
    So then it's time to do the following:
    Write into your journal again.
    Now is the time for reflecting on your day. What did you do great? What could you have done even better?
    
    "The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."
    
    What do I really want to do with my life?
    When do I feel fully alive?
    What were the highlights of my life?
    What am I doing when time flies by? What inspires me?
    What are my greatest strengths?
    What would I do if success was guaranteed?
    What would I do if I had ten million Dollars, seven houses, and had traveled all around the world?
    
    Communicate clearly and make it a habit to address anything that bothers you on the spot. Remember what the proverb says: "In the right tone you can say everything,
     in the wrong tone nothing, the art is to find the right tone." Practice saying things in a neutral tone of voice like you'd say "the sun is shining."
    
    "Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough." - Oprah Winfrey
    
    "Our expectancies not only affect how we see reality but also affect the reality itself."
    
    The benefits of shifting your thinking will be:
    Less stress, fear, and anxiety.
    You will feel more peaceful.
    Your energy level will go up.
    It allows you to be the inventor of your own experience.
    
    "I use memories, but I will not allow memories to use me."
    
    Celebrate that you are better than you were last week! Don't let your small victories go unnoticed.
    
    If you learned new habits and see great improvement, go on a short trip! You earned it.
    
    DO one thing at a time! The newest studies show that multitasking is actually less productive than doing one thing at a time with a concentrated effort. 
    Some studies even imply that it makes you slower and – careful now – dumber.
    
    Forget about multitasking. Focus on doing one thing at a time and do it with concentration!
    
    A huge step towards simplifying your life is to concentrate on the important, on the activities that make sense for you, and find a way to eliminate or downsize the others.
    
    "When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen."
    
    "Be the change you want to see in the world."
    
    "Try not. Do or do not. There is no try."
    
    Just trying doesn't take you anywhere. I'm in line with Master Yoda: Do or do not!
    
    Charged and in the present tense. Here are some examples:
    Money comes to me easily and effortlessly.
    Opportunities come into my life right now.
    Speaking in front of a large audience is easy for me.
    I am successful in my business.
    I am healthy and fit.
    
    Use affirmations to attract the things you want in your life. The more you practice, the better you get. The first time you say...
    
    "It's the repetition of affirmations that lead to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen." - Muhammad Ali
    
    "The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it." - Jordan Belfort
    
    "Always deliver more than expected."
    
    Design your ideal day.
    
    "I'll see it when I believe it!" - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer
    
    Perceive and express emotions (Permit yourself to feel it).
    Facilitation of feelings (How can I feel a different emotion).
    Understanding (Why is this emotion coming up).
    Emotional adjustment (Now I know why the emotion was felt…).
    Advantages of managing emotions:
    You recover better and faster from problems and setbacks.
    You achieve better and consistent professional performance.
    You are able to prevent those tensions from building up that destroy your relationships.
    You govern your impulses and conflicting emotions.
    You stay balanced and serene even in critical moments.

    "Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone." - Pablo Picasso
    
    62: Ask for what you really want
    
    Remember to keep your thoughts, feelings, and inner dialogue positive.
    
    Ask the person who is in charge.
    
    Be specific.
    
    Ask repeatedly like you did when you were a kid.
    
    Make a list of all your complaints.
    
    What have your complaints achieved?
    
    Transform your complaints into requests.
    
    Stop spending time with the wrong people!
    
    "Whatever you do you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    "The person who says it can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person who is doing it."
    
    Stay away from the naysayers, the blamers, the complainers.
    
    "Don't let the noise of the opinions of others drown your own inner voice."
    
    "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
     Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
     They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."
    
    Live the life you want and not the life other people expect of you.
    
    Accept yourself as you are. You don't have to be perfect to be great! Learn to spend time with the most important person in your life – YOU.
    
    Commit yourself to becoming the best person you can be. Invest around 5-10% of your income in training, books, CDs, and other ways of personal development.
    
    Stay curious and eager to learn new things and better yourself. A nice side effect of investing in your personal growth is that while you become a wiser person...
    
    There are so many possibilities: you could learn training that improves your negotiating skills, time management, financial planning, and much more.
    
    "We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be."
    
    "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."
    
    "To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear."
    
    "Those who do not find time for exercise will have to find time for illness."
    
    "Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius and power and magic in it." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
    
    "I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do."
    
    Take action. Make things happen.
    
    "Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step."
    
    Solve your problems. Face them. Because if you are running away from them they will come after you.
    
    "If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. 
    There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever."
    
    "Men have become the tools of their tools."
    
    "As you move outside of your comfort zone, what was once the unknown and frightening becomes your new normal." - Robin Sharma
    
    The price you pay for procrastination is anxiety and feeling bad. Choose your suffering wisely.
    
    There is no guarantee that coaching works. Your success depends on you.
    
    "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
    
    "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop." - Confucius
    
    Make a timeline of your life. From birth until now. Mark every key event in your life on the line. All and any moments that changed your life.
    Write the great moments, the successes above the timeline.
    Write the challenges, the tragedies, the failures below the timeline.
    Examine the events below the line and write the positive effects of them above the line.
    (For example, somebody close to you died. A positive could be that you value your life more. Or perhaps you got fired from a job.
       This opened doors to an even better job that you have now.)
    There is no guarantee that coaching works. Your success depends on you.
    
    "Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."
    
    "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
    I wish I didn't work so hard.
    I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
    I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
    I wish that I had let myself be happier."

    title: '80 20 principle',
    body: `The 80/20 Principle states that there is an inbuilt imbalance between causes and results, inputs and outputs, and effort and reward.

    In 1963, IBM discovered that about 80 percent of a computer’s time is spent executing about 20 percent of the operating code. 
    The company immediately rewrote its operating software to make the most-used 20 percent very accessible and user-friendly, 
    thus making IBM computers more efficient and faster than competitors’ machines for the majority of applications.
    
    We may feel that some of our time is more valuable than the rest, but if we measure inputs and outputs, the disparity can still stun us.
    Does 20 percent of causes lead to 80 percent of results? Is 80 percent of any phenomenon associated with only 20 percent of a related phenomenon?
    
    Any force—whether it is a new product, a disease, a new rock group, or a new social habit such as jogging or roller-blading—finds it difficult to make headway.
    A great deal of effort generates little by way of results. At this point, many pioneers give up. But if the new force persists and can cross a certain invisible line,
    a small amount of additional effort can reap huge returns. This invisible line is the tipping point.
    
    Eighty percent of the results come from 20 percent of the causes.
    
    George Bernard Shaw put it well: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.”
    
    There are two routes to achieving this. One is to reallocate the resources from unproductive to productive uses, the secret of all entrepreneurs down the ages. 
    A firm that finds that 80 percent of its profits come from 20 percent of its customers should use this information to concentrate on keeping that 20 percent happy 
    and increasing the business carried out with them. This is much easier, as well as more rewarding, than paying equal attention to the whole customer group.
    
    Celebrate exceptional productivity, rather than raise average efforts.
    - Look for the shortcut, rather than run the full course.
    - Exercise control over our lives with the least possible effort.
    - Be selective, not exhaustive.
    - Strive for excellence in a few things, rather than good performance in many.
    - Choose our careers and employers with extraordinary care, and if possible employ others rather than being employed ourselves.
    - Only do the thing we are best at doing and enjoy most.
    - In every important sphere, work out where 20 percent of effort can lead to 80 percent of returns.
    - Calm down, work less and target a limited number of very valuable goals where the 80/20 Principle will work for us, rather than pursuing every available opportunity.
    - Make the most of those few “lucky streaks” in our life where we are at our creative peak and the stars line up to guarantee success.
    
    The 80/20 Principle holds that a small percentage of the quality characteristics always contributes a high percentage of the quality loss.
    
    In any market, some suppliers will be much better than others at satisfying customer needs. These suppliers will obtain the highest price realizations and also the 
    highest market shares.
    
    Identify which parts of the business are making very high returns, which are just about washing their faces, and which are disasters. To do this,
    we will conduct an 80/20 Analysis of profits by different categories of business.
    
    The best way to start making money is to stop losing money.
    
    We need to go back to basics and revise the common view of the roots of business success. Waste thrives on complexity; effectiveness requires simplicity.
    
    Do not tackle everything with equal effort. Cost reduction is an expensive business! A simple business will always be better than a complex business. 
    The way to create something great is to create something simple.
    
    All entrepreneurs must believe in themselves and be confident. Entrepreneurs won't succeed at the first attempt; self-belief comes to you when you succeed. 
    While you succeed, always have empathy toward everything; how you make them feel is what you want to feel.
    
    Products from the low-cost factory progressively made goods in higher and higher categories available. Customer satisfaction, customer-centeredness, customer delight, 
    and customer obsession have become the stated goals of most enlightened and successful corporations.
    
    Four steps to lock in your core customers:
    1. Firms selling to tens of thousands or millions of consumers need to know who their key customers are.
    2. You need to provide quite exceptional or even “outrageous” service to them.
    3. Target new products and services at the core 20 percent of customers, developing them solely for and with this group.
    4. Aim to keep your core customers forever.
    
    Get everyone to adopt the methods that have the highest ratio of output to input.
    
    Although good stock management is vital, there are only four key points to it. The most strategic point is to cut down radically on your unprofitable product.
    
    80 percent of achievement and happiness takes place in 20 percent of our time—and these peaks can be expanded greatly.
    
    There are always winners and losers—and always more of the latter. You can be a winner by choosing the right competition, the right team, and the right methods to win. 
    You are more likely to win by rigging the odds in your favor (legitimately and fairly) than by striving to improve your performance. 
    You are more likely to win again where you have won before. You are more likely to win when you are selective about the races you enter.
    
    Most people spend most of their time on activities that are of low value to themselves and others.
    
    Whenever I am tempted to do too much, I remember Ronald Reagan and Warren Buffett. You should think of your own examples, of people you know personally or those in 
    the public eye, who exemplify productive inertia. Think about them often.
    
    Those who achieve the most have to enjoy what they do. It is only by fulfilling oneself that anything of extraordinary value can be created.
    
    Free yourself from obligations imposed by others. Identify, multiply the 20 percent of your time that gives you 80 percent of results, and eliminate or reduce 
    the low-value activities.
    
    The Top 10 low-value uses of time:
    1. Things other people want you to do
    2. Things that have always been done this way
    3. Things you’re not unusually good at doing
    4. Things you don’t enjoy doing
    5. Things that are always interrupted
    6. Things few other people are interested in
    7. Things that have already taken twice as long as you originally expected
    8. Things where your collaborators are unreliable or low quality
    9. Things that have a predictable cycle
    10. Answering the telephone
    
    The Top 10 highest-value uses of time:
    1. Things that advance your overall purpose in life
    2. Things you have always wanted to do
    3. Things already in the 20/80 relationship of time to results
    4. Innovative ways of doing things that promise to slash the time required and/or multiply the quality of results
    5. Things other people tell you can’t be done
    6. Things other people have done successfully in a different arena
    7. Things that use your own creativity
    8. Things that you can get other people to do for you with relatively little effort on your part
    9. Anything with high-quality collaborators who have already transcended the 80/20 rule of time, who use time eccentrically and effectively
    10. Things for which it is now or never
    
    When thinking about any potential use of time, ask two questions:
    • Is it unconventional?
    • Does it promise to
    
     multiply effectiveness?
    It is unlikely to be a good use of time unless the answer to both questions is yes.
    
    Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.
    
    If you are good at something, you can create something that will satisfy others. If you satisfy others, they will generally pay you well for it.
    
    “Success lies on the far side of failure.”
    
    The anthropologists say that if you have too much experience, too early, you exhaust your capacity for further deep relationships.
    
    The project was a total failure. The explanation was that the women were incapable of forming any deep new relationships. They were all used up. 
    Their relationship slots had been filled, forever.
    
    The best relationships are built on five attributes: mutual enjoyment of each other’s company, respect, shared experience, reciprocity, and trust.
    
    Don’t forget that all true and valuable relationships are bilateral.
    
    10 golden rules for career success:
    1. Specialize in a very small niche; develop a core skill.
    2. Choose a niche that you enjoy, where you can excel and stand a chance of becoming an acknowledged leader.
    3. Realize that knowledge is power.
    4. Identify your market and your core customers and serve them best.
    5. Identify where 20 percent of effort gives 80 percent of returns.
    6. Learn from the best.
    7. Become self-employed early in your career.
    8. Employ as many net value creators as possible.
    9. Use outside contractors for everything but your core skill.
    10. Exploit capital leverage.
    
    Leaders think and feel differently. Leaders are usually outsiders; they think and feel differently.
    
    Karl Marx’s theory of surplus value states that the workers produce all value and excess value is appropriated by the capitalists who employ the workers.
    
    Capital leverage is using money to capture additional surplus value. At its most basic, 
    it means buying machines to replace labor whenever the machines are more cost-effective.
    
    A key to successful personal investing is to match your personality and skills to one of a number of proven techniques.
    
    Koch’s 10 commandments of investment:
    1. Make your investment philosophy reflect your personality.
    2. Be proactive and unbalanced.
    3. Invest mainly in the stock market.
    4. Invest for the long term.
    5. Invest most when the market is low.
    6. If you can’t beat the market, track it.
    7. Build your investments on your expertise.
    8. Consider the merits of emerging markets.
    9. Cull your loss-makers.
    10. Run your gains.
    
    Aristotle said that the goal of all human activity should be happiness. Down the ages, we haven’t listened much to Aristotle.
    
    Two ways to be happier:
    • Identify the times when you are happiest and expand them as much as possible.
    • Identify the times when you are least happy and reduce them as much as possible.
    
    By cultivating habits of optimism, you can help to prevent disease as well as have a happier life. 
    The best way to start being happy is to stop being unhappy; avoid situations and people that tend to make us depressed or miserable.`

    **Statement by a Vietnamese monk, Thich Nhat Hanh:** "The path is the goal."
    
    **Preface**
    
    What is your Life's goal?
    
    **Preface xvi**
    
    The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by a Vietnamese monk, Thich Nhat Hanh: "The path is the goal." In other words,
     finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is not your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your successes and failures.
    
    Me. Traditional education was crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of fear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing,
     and the fear of not getting a job.
    
    I had no desire to study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From then on, if I did attend a course or school,
     I went to learn, to become a better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees, and credentials.
    
    **Does school prepare you for the real world?**
    
    The more I studied, the more I understood why I did not like school.
    
    So many "A" students get stuck in "analysis paralysis," studying every little detail but failing to do anything. This "analysis paralysis" is caused by our educational system 
    punishing students for making mistakes.
    
    The reason so many people fail to achieve success is that they fail to fail enough times.
    
    Life was more important than money, but that money was important for supporting life.
    
    Money is important, but I don’t want to spend life working for it.
    
    One of the quotes credited to Ford goes: "Thinking is the hardest work there is. That is why so few people engage in it."
    
    "Leadership," rich dad said, "is the ability to bring out the best in people." So he trained his son and me in the technical skills necessary for becoming successful 
    in business—technical skills such as reading financial statements, marketing, sales, accounting, management, production, and negotiation.
    
    In this lesson, he stressed that we needed to learn to work with and lead people. Rich dad always said, "The technical skills of business are easy. 
    The hard part is working with people." As a reminder, I still read Stone Soup today because I personally have a tendency to be a tyrant, instead of a leader, 
    when things don’t go my way.
    
    But only a few who attempt this actually make it. Why? Because the technical skills and human skills to be successful in each quadrant are different.
    You must learn the skills and mindset required by a quadrant in order to find true success there.
    
    **B business owners** can go on vacation forever because they own a system, not a job. If the B is on vacation, 
    the money still comes in. To be successful as a B requires:
    1. Ownership or control of systems, and
    2. The ability to lead people.
    
    Most of us have heard that the secrets to great riches and wealth are:
    • OPT — Other People’s Time
    • OPM — Other People’s Money
    OPT and OPM are found in the B and I quadrants.
    
    In designing a B type of business, success simply means increasing the system and hiring more people. In other words, you work less, earn more and enjoy more free time.
    
    Regardless of how much money people make, ultimately they should put some in the I quadrant. 
    The I quadrant is where your money makes more money. It’s based on the idea that your money works hard so you don’t have to work.
    
    **Other Forms of Investing:** People invest in their education. Traditional education is important. 
    The more education you have, the better your chances may be to earn more money.
    
    We aren’t properly prepared to handle the differences between the Industrial Age and the Information Age.
    
    The idea of "study hard and find a safe, secure job" is an idea born in the Industrial Age.
    
    It takes neither money to be financially free, nor a good formal education. It also doesn’t have to be risky. 
    Instead, freedom’s price is measured in dreams, desire, and the ability to overcome disappointments that occur along the way.
    
    I think the reason most fail in the first five years is due to lack of experience and lack of capital. 
    The reason the one survivor often fails in the second five years isn’t due to lack of capital, but lack of energy. 
    The hours of long, hard work finally get to the person. Many S’s just burn out.
    
    My highly educated dad was fixated on job security, as are most people of his generation. He assumed that job security meant financial security.
    
    Just as we study at school to learn a job, I suggest you study to become a professional investor.
    
    Even if you don’t have much money, it’s important to invest in your education because, when the changes come, you’ll be better prepared to handle them.
    
    Your goal is to own a system and have people work that system for you.
    
    If operated properly, each system will provide a steady stream of income without much physical effort on the part of the owner once it’s up and running. 
    The problem is getting it up and running.
    
    There are three ways you can make it to the B side quickly.
    1. Find a mentor.
    My rich dad was my mentor. A mentor is someone who has already done what you want to do and is successful at doing it.
    
    A true B is more than a system. It’s also dependent on good people to operate the system.
    
    To be successful, you need to learn to overcome your fear of being rejected and to stop worrying about what other people say and think about you.
    
    2. To be successful, you must also learn to lead people. Working with different kinds of people is the hardest thing about business.
    The people I’ve met who are successful in any business are those who are natural leaders. The ability to get along with and inspire people is a priceless skill,
    a skill that can be learned.
    
    Have a strong mentor program. You want to learn from leaders, not advisors. You want to learn from people who are already leaders, who are on the right side, 
    and who want you to succeed.
    
    Five things happen to people who do not invest, or who invest poorly:
    1. They work hard all their lives.
    2. They worry about money all their lives.
    3. They depend on others, such as family, a company pension, or the government, to take care of them.
    4. The boundaries of their lives are defined by money.
    5. They will not know what true freedom is.
    
    Learning to invest is more important than learning a profession.
    
    My point is that it is never the investment or asset class that is important. Success or failure, wealth or poverty, depends solely on how smart the investor is. 
    A smart investor will make millions in the stock market. An amateur will lose millions.
    
    The bond market is the biggest market in the world, bigger than the stock market or the real estate market.
    
    Once a person is successful in the B quadrant, life is easy. The challenge is becoming successful.
    
    If you are here as a professional investor, congratulations. Very few people invest the time to learn and manage their own money. 
    The key to success at Level 4 is lifelong learning, great teachers, great coaches, and like-minded friends.
    
    Level-4 investors take control of their lives, knowing that their mistakes are their opportunities to learn and to grow.
    
    The fear of investing does not frighten them. It challenges them.
    
    
    
    In my world, ROI stands for a Return On Information. This means that the more information I have, the higher my returns—and the lower my risk.
    
    Remember that anything important can’t really be learned in the classroom. It must be learned by taking action, making mistakes, and then correcting them. That’s 
    when wisdom sets in.
    
    If money isn’t first in your head, it won’t stick to your hands. If it doesn’t stick to your hands, then money, and people with money, will stay away from you.
    
    Most people go to school and learn to be players in the game, but no one explains the rules to them.
    
    The real issue is the changes you must go through and who you become in the process.
    
    "Be careful of money’s addictive power," he often said. "Once you get used to receiving it, that addiction keeps you attached to the way you got it."
    
    An E works for the system. An S is the system. A B creates, owns, and controls the system. An I invests money into the system.
    
    Winston Churchill once said: "Personally, I am always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught."
    
    **Take Baby Steps:** You’ve got to walk before you can run.
    
    True learning requires mental, emotional, and physical learning. That is why action always beats inaction.
    
    People who write down their goals are more likely to achieve them.
    
    For people who want to be successful in the Information Age, the faster they develop their financial and emotional intelligence, the faster they will feel more financially
     secure and find financial freedom.
    
    The key to making any investment is setting a big goal and approaching it systematically, taking baby steps first and then gradually increasing the size of your investments
     as your learning and experience increase.
    
    In the Information Age, the people who work the hardest physically will be paid the least. It is already true today and has been true throughout history.
    
    **It's Time to Mind Your Own Business:** We are programmed to mind everyone else’s business, and ignore our own.
    
    1. Employees, making their bosses and owners rich.
    2. Debtors, making banks and money lenders rich.
    3. Taxpayers, making the government rich.
    4. Consumers, making many other businesses rich.
    
    People who cannot control their cash flow work for those who can.
    
    That is why he loved rental properties. He encouraged me to buy rental real estate because "the bank gives you the loan, but your tenant pays for it."
    
    Choose your mentors wisely. Be careful from whom you take advice. If you want to go somewhere, it is best to find someone who has already taken the journey.
     For example, if you decide to climb Mount Everest next year, obviously you would seek advice from someone who had climbed the mountain before. 
     However, when it comes to climbing financial mountains, most people get advice from people who are stuck in financial swamps.
    
    Seek mentors. Find individuals in both the investment and business arenas who might act as mentors to you.
    A. Seek out role models. Learn from them.
    B. Seek out reverse role models. Learn from them.
    
    I wanted to change my future. To do that, I had to change my thoughts, and the people I spent time with.
    
    Inside every disappointment lies a priceless gem of wisdom.
    
    I offer you the same words of advice and encouragement that rich dad offered me when I was learning something new: Be prepared to be disappointed.
    
    I have found that people who are hard on themselves mentally and emotionally are often too cautious when it comes to taking risks, adopting new ideas, 
    or attempting something new. It is hard to learn anything new if you punish yourself for your personal disappointments.
    
    Financially, there have been many times I could have run from my mistakes, but running away is taking the easy way out.
    
    "The size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire, the size of your dream, and how you handle disappointment along the way."
    
    "The times they are a-changin’." The people who are most in control of their emotions, who do not let their emotions hold them back,
     and who have the emotional maturity to learn new financial skills will flourish in the years ahead.
    
    The only person who determines the thoughts you choose to believe about yourself is you.
    
    Mirrors also reflect back our thoughts and our opinions of ourselves.
    
    These thoughts or opinions are much more important than our outward appearance.
    
    You will always hold yourself back.
    
    Begin building pipelines of cash flow to support you and your family.`

    title: 'Deep Work',
    body: `**Deep Work:** 
    Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push
    your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
    
    Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think
    big thoughts.
    
    **Shallow Work:** 
    Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
    
    To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work.
     If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.
    
    The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful,
     its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, 
     if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.
    
    **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** 
    The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence,
     the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
    
    For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, 
    employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” And when only a human will do, improvements in communications and collaboration 
    technology are making remote work easier than ever before, motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars—leaving the local talent pool underemployed.
    
    **Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:**
    1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
    2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
    
    That you be able to quickly master the latest research on relevant procedures. If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.
    
    If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. 
    You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.
    
    If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.
    
    To advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically.
    
    This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows:
    1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master.
    2. You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.
    
    The first component is of particular importance to our discussion, as it emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, 
    and that it instead requires uninterrupted concentration. As Ericsson emphasizes, “Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused attention required by deliberate practice” (emphasis mine).
    
    Myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. 
    To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. 
    This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, 
    allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.
    
    By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. 
    This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively 
    cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way 
    to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) 
    in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group 
    of neurons you actually want to strengthen.
    
    To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work.
    
    **High-Quality Work Equation:**
    High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
    
    The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, 
    your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. 
    This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, 
    your attention remains divided for a while.
    
    By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, 
    allowing him to maximize performance on this one task.
    
    Stopwatch monitoring the efficiency of worker movements—looking for ways to increase the speed at which they accomplished their tasks.
    
    “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”
    
    “Concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.”
    
    The habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that these issues remain at the forefront of their attention.
    
    Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, 
    all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, 
    is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
    
    “Deep work chambers” (he adopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick 
    soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow.”
    
    You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
    
    If you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent web browsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, 
    you’ll draw heavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess. Such attempts will therefore frequently fail.
    
    You could just try to make deep work a priority. But supporting this decision with the strategies that follow—or strategies of your own devising that are motivated by
     the same principles—will significantly increase the probability that you succeed in making deep work a crucial part of your professional life.
    
    You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify.
    
    You divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.
    
    The easiest way to consistently start deep work
    
     sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.
    
    Set starting time that you use every day for deep work.
    
    There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where… but I hope [my work] 
    makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice
     I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.
    
    Where you’ll work and for how long. Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
     This location can be as simple as your normal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off. Regardless of where you work, 
     be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.
    
    How you’ll work once you start to work. Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any internet use, 
    or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, 
    you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard.
     These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.
    
    How you’ll support your work. Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. 
    For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee or make sure you have access to enough 
    food of the right type to maintain energy or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear. To maximize your success, 
    you need to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment.
    
    To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room 
    until you complete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources.
    Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.
    
    A setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, 
    we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.
    
    Four “disciplines” (abbreviated, 4DX) for helping companies successfully implement high-level strategies.
    
    **Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important:**
    For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. 
    The general exhortation to “spend more time working deeply” doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm. 
    To instead have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm.
    
    **Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures:**
    Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose:
     lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, 
     then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.” Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well. In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.
    
    **Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard:**
    “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” It’s important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. 
    This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. 
    It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.
    
    **Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability:**
    The habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX,
     I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, 
     figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure — 
     enabling significantly more deep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.
    
    Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. 
    When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done.
    
    If every moment of potential boredom in your life —say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a 
    quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even 
    if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.
    
    Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.
    
    You should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. Keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, 
    record the next time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.
    
    If you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, 
    the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of 
    similar mental training.
    
    Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
    
    Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
    
    To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting 
    behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.
    
    Concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off.
    
    In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d 
    normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. Then motivate yourself by setting a 
    countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid seeing it as you work.
    
    The more you practice resisting such urges, the
    
     easier such resistance becomes. After a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of what it means to focus will likely be transformed as 
     you reach levels of intensity stronger than anything you’ve experienced before.
    
    The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your 
    attention on a single well-defined professional problem.
    
    To succeed with productive meditation, it’s important to recognize that, like any form of meditation, it requires practice to do well.
    
    When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.
    
    Try to picture the scene as clearly as possible - to memorization.
    
    White recommends that you begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in your home. Perhaps you come in the door, 
    walk through your front hallway, then turn into the downstairs bathroom, walk out the door and enter the guest bedroom, 
    walk into the kitchen, and then head down the stairs into your basement. In each room, conjure a clear image of what you see. 
    Once you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms. 
    White recommends that these items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, 
    establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, 
    then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, 
    to get to the full fifty-two items you’ll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck.
    
    To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.
    
    These services are engineered to be addictive—robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals 
    (such as deep work). Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyper-distracted connectivity that plagued Baratunde 
    Thurston and millions of others like him.
    
    The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits.

    title: 'Do the work',
    body: `The following is a list of the forces arrayed against us as artists and entrepreneurs:**
    1. Resistance (i.e., fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism, etc.)
    2. Rational thought
    3. Friends and family
    
    **Resistance is a repelling force.** It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.
    
    **The problem with friends and family** is that they know us as we are. They are invested in maintaining us as we are.
    
    **Once we commit to action,** the worst thing we can do is to stop.
    
    **The enemy is our chattering brain,** which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, 
    and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do.
    
    **If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first.** If you’re opening a restaurant, begin with the experience you want the diner to have when she walks in and enjoys a meal. 
    If you’re preparing a seduction, determine the state of mind you want the process of romancing to bring your lover to.
    
    **Figure out where you want to go;** then work backward from there.
    
    **One trick they use is to boil down their presentation to the following:**
    1. A killer opening scene
    2. Two major set pieces in the middle
    3. A killer climax
    4. A concise statement of the theme
    
    **Any project or enterprise can be broken down into beginning, middle, and end.** Fill in the gaps; then fill in the gaps between the gaps.
    
    **One rule for first full working drafts:** Get them done ASAP.
    
    **Ideas come according to their own logic.** That logic is not rational. It’s not linear. We may get the middle before we get the end. 
    We may get the end before we get the beginning. Be ready for this. Don’t resist it.
    
    **In writing, “action” means putting words on paper.** “Reflection” means evaluating what we have on paper.
    
    **How much time can you spare each day?** For that interval, close the door and—short of a family emergency or the outbreak of World War III—don’t let ANYBODY in. 
    Keep working. Keep working. Keep working.
    
    **There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us.** Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. 
    It saved my life, and it will save yours.
    
    **You can board a spaceship to Pluto and settle, all by yourself, into a perfect artist’s cottage ten zillion miles from Earth. Resistance will still be with you.** 
    The enemy is inside you.
    
    **The Enemy Is Inside You, But It Is Not You.** The fourth axiom of Resistance is that the enemy is inside you, but it is not you. 
    What does that mean? It means you are not to blame for the voices of Resistance you hear in your head. They are not your “fault.” You have done nothing “wrong.” 
    You have committed no “sin.” I have that same voice in my head. So
    
    **Resistance Arises Second.** The sixth principle of Resistance (and the key to overcoming it) is that Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, 
    the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us.
    
    **The dream is your project, your vision, your symphony, your startup.** The love is the passion and enthusiasm that fill your heart when you envision your project’s 
    completion.
    
    **Test Number One: “How bad do you want it?”**
    
    **Test Number Two: “Why do you want it?”**
    - To prove my old man (or ex-spouse, mother, teacher, coach) wrong.
    
    **The only items you get to keep are love for the work, will to finish, and passion to serve the ethical, creative Muse.**
    
    **The Big Crash is so predictable, across all fields of enterprise, that we can practically set our watches by it. Bank on it. It’s gonna happen.**
    
    **The worst part of the Big Crash is that nothing can prepare us for it.**
    
    **Because finishing is the critical part of any project.** If we can’t finish, all our work is for nothing.`

    body: ` "What does it take to make money?" My answer is that it takes a dream, a lot of determination, a willingness to learn quickly,
     and the ability to use your God-given assets properly.
    
    **EXPERT BUSINESS #1: SELLING INFORMATION PRODUCTS**
    It involves you taking the life lessons that you've learned and packaging them into information products, coaching, and consulting. 
    Being an expert and selling information products is, in my opinion, the greatest start-up in the world.
    
    If I was studying Adolph Hitler and the Nazi party or Jesus Christ and Christianity, 
    all the examples I found had three things in common that helped them build a mass movement:

    1. They each had a charismatic leader or an attractive character.
    2. Each of them focused on a future-based cause that was bigger than themselves.
    3. They each offered their audience a new opportunity.
    
    You see, people become leaders when they first try to master something for themselves. Then, after they've discovered a path for themselves, 
    they share their knowledge with others. It starts with your own personal growth but then transitions to contribution.
    
    Your results are your certification. Maintain absolute certainty. It is said that in any situation, the person with the most certainty wins. 
    I'm not talking about self-confidence. As my buddy Setema Gali says, "Self-confidence is for kids." If you want to make an impact, you have to be certain. 
    Certainty is what draws people to leaders, to experts.
    
    It's important to understand that when you first start, you are not posting these for your audience—you're posting them for you. Eventually, people will start to follow, 
    but initially, it's so you can discover your voice.
    
    People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions, 
    and help them throw rocks at their enemies.
    
    Understand, though, that you don't become that leader overnight. Start sharing your message and become consistent with it so you can find your voice. 
    Figure out where your message can polarize people into true fans. Share your backstory and flaws. Be transparent. 
    And over time, you will naturally become the leader your tribe needs.
    
    I rewrote that headline dozens of times. "You're just one funnel away from quitting your job." "You're just one funnel away from financial freedom." 
    "You're just one funnel away from growing your business to the next level." "You're just one funnel away from sharing your message with more people."
    
    What is the 4-minute mile for your movement? Initially, the 4-minute mile will need to be something that you've already accomplished, 
    so you can show them it's possible and give them hope and belief that they can do it as well. 
    As you shift your focus to helping others accomplish the same results and breaking their 4-minute mile, you'll notice something strange will happen inside your movement. 
    Your focus will be taken off of you making money and into giving results to others, and for some odd reason...
    
    Your culture needs a Title of Liberty. Something they can look at when they're feeling doubtful—a rallying call. 
    Something that will help them know who YOU are, remind them who THEY are, and refocus them on where you are going together.
    
    **Identify the charismatic leader. Who are you?**
    My name is Russell Brunson.
    **Identify the movement.**
    I'm part of a group of underground entrepreneurs you've probably never heard of.
    
    When you study the successful mass movements of the past, you'll notice that each of the leaders offered their followers a new opportunity. 
    Christ didn't give his followers a better way to follow Moses' law; he offered them a NEW law, 
    a new covenant where salvation didn't come from animal sacrifices and following the letter of the law.
    
    Our goal is not to fix what's not working. Our goal is to REPLACE what's not working with something better.
    
    Most often, when people start thinking about the product or the service they want to offer, they start by looking around at what is already out there, 
    and then they try to "build a better mousetrap." When you do that, you are not offering them a new opportunity; you are offering them what we call an "improvement" offer.
    
    So which factors elevate status? Well, it's different for everyone, but here are a few that are pretty universal:
    - Appearance of intelligence (anything that makes them look smarter)
    - Appearance of wealth, power, or happiness
    - Physical appearance (weight loss, makeup, supplements, etc.)
    - Style (think Mac vs. PC)
    
    **STEP #1: GET EARLY RESULTS BY WORKING FOR FREE**
    
    It doesn't matter if you're selling physical products, digital information, or service programs. Go out there and work for free. Get some results. 
    If what you're doing works, then capture those stories and testimonials. Use them to attract and convert your dream clients.
    
    This angle shows how something that's been done successfully in the past is about to be made obsolete. You're persuading them that soon this will be common knowledge, 
    but they can get in now and have early success.
    
    Are you tired?
    
    Belief creates the customer. Belief creates the results.
    
    If I can make people believe that my new opportunity is the key to what they desire most and is only attainable through my specific vehicle, 
    then all other objections and concerns become irrelevant, and they have to give me money.
    
    Any time you're speaking (or writing) and you hit a friction point where some people may not understand what you're trying to convey, just say, 
    "it's kinda like..." and relate it to something easy to understand. This keeps your stories simple, entertaining, and effective. Oversimplification is the key.
    
    I want to transition into story structure. When you learn the right structure for telling your stories and you apply the concepts you learned here, 
    you will become a master at storytelling and story selling.
    
    If I want you to have the same epiphany I had, you need to be in the same state that I was in when I had that epiphany.
    
    Make the character a victim of some outside force, so we want to root for them.
    - Put the character in jeopardy, so we worry about them.
    - Make the character likable, so we want to be with them.
    - Make the character funny, so we connect with them.
    - Make the character powerful, so we want to be like them.
    
    1. The vehicle or new opportunity
    2. Their ability to use the vehicle (internal beliefs)
    3. The #1 thing they believe is keeping them from getting started (external beliefs)
    
    I want them to realize that investing in this thing shouldn't cost them any money; it should only save them money. So remind them what they are now able to do, 
    but also what they will be able to get rid of. Hopefully, the money they save will be more than what they are actually paying. That way, it's a truly irresistible offer.
    
    You can probably see why people pay $__________ for a similar result from me because it's not a cost—it's an INVESTMENT.
    
    That single concept has made me more money than anything else I've ever done in this business. Study it. Master it. There is no greater gift I could give you than this.
    
    1. Become VERY clear about who you want to serve and what new opportunity you will create.
    2. Get results for your beta group. Your results will become the foundation your expert business
    
     will grow from.
    3. Become a master storyteller. This is the most important skill you can learn.
    4. Change the world. Your message has the ability to change people's lives, so use it.`

    If your desired end is learning, is taking a fall a failure or success? Is it really better to climb an easy route and succeed (with no learning process) 
    or fall off a difficult one but learn something new and become a better climber?
    
    The next time you fail, resist the temptation to let anger, frustration, discouragement, or self-guilt make you give up. Give yourself time to process the negative emotions,
     and then make a list of the lessons you've learned from not reaching your desired outcome.
    
    1. The second common type of failure is failure due to unrealistic expectations. Some people get stuck in a cycle in which they set unreasonable expectations, fail, 
    try again, and fail again due to being unrealistic with what they can accomplish.
    2. To prevent this failure from happening, make sure to do proper research before setting a goal. Ignorance leads to unrealistic expectations, which leads to failure. 
    Be particularly careful when you're a newbie. Assume you'll achieve average results and focus on proven strategies instead of seeking magic pills.
    3. Be open to changing your approach if your current strategy isn't working. Being stubborn when your approach isn't effective won't magically make it work.
    4. Accept that things rarely go as planned. It might take you longer to reach your goal than you'd like,
     and you'll probably overestimate what you can achieve in a short period of time. Be patient.
    
    In today's world of never-ending busyness and hundreds of tasks to do, failure due to a lack of focus is one of the most common reasons why people can't achieve their goals.
    
    Successful entrepreneur Craig Ballantyne suggests in his article, "You Have Never Thought This Way Before," that if you want to finish your product and start a business, 
    "Book a hotel conference room if you must. Pay the money upfront so you won't back out. Arrive there early and lock yourself in and don't come out until you have a product 
    to put online.
    
    The longer you hesitate, the less likely you'll be to act.
    
    It's important to acknowledge that the biggest failure in life is to remain the same person throughout the years. As they say, if you're not growing, you're dying.
    
    1. Fear of the unknown
    2. Fear of rejection
    3. Fear of losing your identity
    4. Fear of losing connection
    
    It's key to understand that, try as you might, you're not going to change other people's deeply-held beliefs about certain important issues. 
    I couldn't persuade my parents that one could succeed in life without going to college. 
    They only believed me when I started making more money than 99.9% of people of my age.
    
    It's common for a person suffering from a lack of confidence to invent insignificant problems so they can have an excuse not to face the big ones.
    
    1. Believe in your goal
    A lack of confidence leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: you don't believe you can achieve something, and that's exactly what happens. 
    One of the most effective ways to overcome this problem is to not develop a belief in yourself but in your goal. 
    When you're working on an extremely important goal, increased self-confidence will be a side effect of your efforts.
    
    The first step to deal with this type of failure is to believe in your goal. If you can't develop the confidence in yourself, 
    develop the belief that the goal you're pursuing is something you absolutely must reach. This, as if by association, 
    will help you develop more conviction in your abilities to make it come to pass.
    
    Most goals require the marathoner's approach. While you can kick things off with a short sprint, eventually you'll have to transition into a more sustainable tempo and 
    temper your impetuousness.
    
    People often fail because they're impatient. They'll either give up, frustrated by the slow progress, or they'll set an unsustainable tempo, anxious to succeed as 
    quickly as possible. In both cases, failure is more likely than success.
    
    If you often fail because slow progress discourages you, focus on reaching the goal itself, not on reaching it within a made-up deadline. Deadlines should be rough 
    estimates; they can't dictate your life.
    
    If you want to grow as a person, you need to challenge yourself.
    
    "Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
    
    YOU MUST LIVE YOUR LIFE THE HARD WAY AND REGULARLY EMBRACE UNCERTAINTY.
    
    "The quality of your life is in direct proportion to the amount of uncertainty you can comfortably live with. The more uncertainty you can live with, the more you'll try, 
    the more you'll learn, the more alive you'll be. The more you got to be certain about everything, the less you'll have.
    
    Let me assure you that nobody cares about your failures as much as you think. When you're worried about others laughing at your clumsy attempts, they're often equally 
    worried that they look silly in your eyes!
    
    1. Show the middle finger to your ego. A fear of embarrassment should be the last thing on your mind when you're learning something new. If you don't try again 
    because you're afraid of looking stupid, that's when you actually exhibit unintelligent behavior.
    2. Don't take your embarrassing failures seriously. Laughing them off will help you process them quickly, while dwelling on them and worrying about your image 
    will only prolong the suffering.
    
    Convert your feelings of love into inspiration to keep growing, as this will enable you to help others even more. 
    As such a caring person, you're more than worthy of success and will do a lot of good when you turn your dreams into reality.
    
    If you limit your growth because you're afraid of hurting others, remind yourself that becoming a better person gives you more resources to help them.
    2. If you don't recognize your strengths, make a list of your motivations, strengths, relationships, and other assets that can help you achieve your goal. 
    Then think of past situations that you solved, thanks to these resources.
    
    Eliminate phrases like "I have no choice" from your vocabulary.
    
    The key to beginning the process of bouncing back from failure is to accept that in the beginning of learning how to cope with it, 
    you will feel numb and deny the negative emotions. Trying to suppress this stage will only prolong the process. 
    If you can pull yourself together almost instantly, that's great. If not, don't rush it.
    
    Here are some suggestions on how to make yourself feel good:
    - Seek positive friends who can help you relax and offer reassurance.
    - Listen to music you love.
    - Meditate or engage in another type of meditative practice.
    - Practice a sport you love.
    - Go out for a walk.
    - Take a long, warm shower or bath.
    - Play with a pet.
    - Cuddle.
    - Have a massage.
    
    Some people who experience failure feel self-hatred, mistakenly equating the act of failing with being a failure. 
    Learning how to turn self-criticism into self-compassion is crucial to cope with failure and bounce back with renewed confidence.
    
    The third step is to change your emotional state. If you've dealt with the first and second phase of handling a failure, now you're probably angry that you failed 
    or you alternate between feeling sad and pissed. Neither state is useful if you want to process the failure because they cloud your judgment with strong emotions that 
    make you unable to look at the failure from a more neutral point of view.
    
    Engage in activities that will help you let off some steam and take your mind off the failure. Staying home and fuming at the failure isn't going to change anything; 
    you need to put some distance between yourself and the failure to be able to learn from it and bounce back.
    
    Create a list of lessons you've learned from your failure. Then, try to find a common thread — one key lesson that will help you change your approach and 
    succeed with the next attempt.
    
    Take your time to identify the key lesson from the failure. It's better to spend a few days more analyzing your failure than to resume working on your goal, 
    only to fail yet again due to the same (unidentified) cause. This step is essential to leverage failure as a valuable tool for your future endeavors.
    
    Tony Robbins defines addiction as a behavior (negative or positive) that meets at least three of six human needs: certainty, variety, significance, connection/love, 
    growth, and contribution. Your activity must also meet three of those same needs.
    
    When you devote yourself to a certain activity and it becomes a long-term passion, you'll stick to it no matter what happens. It will be too hard to break the habit just because 
    you no longer feel like doing it. Such devotion to a passion is a powerful master strategy to encourage positive mindset changes, build grit, and grow as a person. 
    I consider it a must-have for people who want to achieve their full potential.
    
    Developing a passion that forces you to step outside your comfort zone and/or delivers other lessons that you can apply when working on other goals is a powerful master strategy 
    for becoming a successful person. It's one thing to read about someone's experiences and quite another to draw parallels between your own experiences; 
    nothing can replace the latter in its effectiveness and applicability to your own situation.
    
    To conduct a successful experiment, set a budget (choose a specific amount of resources you'll dedicate to it, be it money, time, or energy) and run it until you get solid data.
    
    Society pressures young people to go to college. And those who want to consider an alternative career choice or start a business?
    
    1. If you're chasing something only because society tells you to do so — as in the case of going to college or working in a job you hate — you're wasting resources that you could have 
    spent on something more aligned with your personality and outlook on life.
    2. If you associate your goal primarily (or even worse — exclusively) with daily negative emotions, you should give up, as the objective is clearly not congruent with your personality.
    3. Working on the wrong goal doesn't just make you lose the time and energy invested in pursuing the objective itself. It also costs you in lost opportunities and mismanaged resources.
    
    If you're unsatisfied with your results after a reasonable amount of time and other resources invested in your goal and don't see any possibilities for improvement, maybe you should find something else you'd be better at.
    
    2. The decision to give up or keep going when you aren't satisfied with your results comes down to managing your expectations. If you can lower your expectations and still feel good, keep going.
     If you refuse to accept lower standards, it's better to give up.
    
    Persistence is good as long as you care about your objective. If you're pursuing your goal simply because of sunk costs — costs you've already incurred that you can't get back — you should give up.
    
    2. Consider your losses the cost of learning. When it no longer makes sense to pursue your goal, accept that what you've lost was, in fact, an investment in your education, and it's now time to conclude it.
    
    If you're constantly playing catch-up with your goal, it indicates that it isn't a priority to you or that you have too much on your plate. If you can find time for other things, 
    but rarely for your supposedly important goal, perhaps you no longer care about the goal as you used to, and it might be better to give up.
    
    2. You'll maximize your results if you forego some of the less important goals and focus more on your key objective. In the end, you'll need to choose between multiple goals and mediocre 
    performance or few goals and excellence.`

    If your desired end is learning, is taking a fall a failure or success? Is it really better to climb an easy route and succeed (with no learning process) 
    or fall off a difficult one but learn something new and become a better climber?
    
    The next time you fail, resist the temptation to let anger, frustration, discouragement, or self-guilt make you give up.

    1. The second common type of failure is failure due to unrealistic expectations. Some people get stuck in a cycle in which they set unreasonable expectations, 
    fail, try again, and fail again due to being unrealistic with what they can accomplish.
    2. To prevent this failure from happening, make sure to do proper research before setting a goal. Ignorance leads to unrealistic expectations, which leads to failure. 
    Be particularly careful when you're a newbie. Assume you'll achieve average results and focus on proven strategies instead of seeking magic pills.
    3. Be open to changing your approach if your current strategy isn't working. Being stubborn when your approach isn't effective won't magically make it work.
    4. Accept that things rarely go as planned. It might take you longer to reach your goal than you'd like, and you'll probably overestimate what you can achieve in a 
    short period of time. Be patient.
    
    In today's world of never-ending busyness and hundreds of tasks to do, failure due to a lack of focus is one of the most common reasons why people can't achieve their goals.
    
    Successful entrepreneur Craig Ballantyne suggests in his article, "You Have Never Thought This Way Before," that if you want to finish your product and start a business, 
    "Book a hotel conference room if you must. Pay the money upfront so you won't back out. Arrive there early and lock yourself in and don't come out until you have a product 
    to put online.
    
    The longer you hesitate, the less likely you'll be to act.
    
    It's important to acknowledge that the biggest failure in life is to remain the same person throughout the years. As they say, if you're not growing, you're dying.
    
    1. Fear of the unknown
    2. Fear of rejection
    3. Fear of losing your identity
    4. Fear of losing connection
    
    It's key to understand that, try as you might, you're not going to change other people's deeply-held beliefs about certain important issues. 
    I couldn't persuade my parents that one could succeed in life without going to college. 
    They only believed me when I started making more money than 99.9% of people of my age.
    
    It's common for a person suffering from a lack of confidence to invent insignificant problems so they can have an excuse not to face the big ones.
    
    1. Believe in your goal
    A lack of confidence leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: you don't believe you can achieve something, and that's exactly what happens. 
    One of the most effective ways to overcome this problem is to not develop a belief in yourself but in your goal. When you're working on an extremely 
    important goal, increased self-confidence will be a side effect of your efforts.
    
    The first step to deal with this type of failure is to believe in your goal. If you can't develop the confidence in yourself, develop the belief that the goal 
    you're pursuing is something you absolutely must reach. This, as if by association, will help you develop more conviction in your abilities to make it come to pass.
    
    Most goals require the marathoner's approach. While you can kick things off with a short sprint, eventually you'll have to transition into a more sustainable 
    tempo and temper your impetuousness.
    
    People often fail because they're impatient. They'll either give up, frustrated by the slow progress, or they'll set an unsustainable tempo, anxious to succeed as 
    quickly as possible. In both cases, failure is more likely than success.
    
    If you often fail because slow progress discourages you, focus on reaching the goal itself, not on reaching it within a made-up deadline. Deadlines should be rough 
    estimates; they can't dictate your life.
    
    If you want to grow as a person, you need to challenge yourself.
    
    "Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
    
    YOU MUST LIVE YOUR LIFE THE HARD WAY AND REGULARLY EMBRACE UNCERTAINTY.
    
    "The quality of your life is in direct proportion to the amount of uncertainty you can comfortably live with. The more uncertainty you can live with, 
    the more you'll try, the more you'll learn, the more alive you'll be. The more you got to be certain about everything, the less you'll have.
    
    Let me assure you that nobody cares about your failures as much as you think. When you're worried about others laughing at your clumsy attempts, 
    they're often equally worried that they look silly in your eyes!
    
    1. Show the middle finger to your ego. A fear of embarrassment should be the last thing on your mind when you're learning something new. If you don't try 
    again because you're afraid of looking stupid, that's when you actually exhibit unintelligent behavior.
    2. Don't take your embarrassing failures seriously. Laughing them off will help you process them quickly, while dwelling on them and worrying about your image 
    will only prolong the suffering.
    
    Convert your feelings of love into inspiration to keep growing, as this will enable you to help others even more. As such a caring person, you're more than worthy 
    of success and will do a lot of good when you turn your dreams into reality.
    
    If you limit your growth because you're afraid of hurting others, remind yourself that becoming a better person gives you more resources to help them.
    2. If you don't recognize your strengths, make a list of your motivations, strengths, relationships, and other assets that can help you achieve your goal. 
    Then think of past situations that you solved, thanks to these resources.
    
    Eliminate phrases like "I have no choice" from your vocabulary.
    
    The key to beginning the process of bouncing back from failure is to accept that in the beginning of learning how to cope with it, you will feel numb and deny 
    the negative emotions. Trying to suppress this stage will only prolong the process. If you can pull yourself together almost instantly, that's great. 
    If not, don't rush it.
    
    Here are some suggestions on how to make yourself feel good:
    - Seek positive friends who can help you relax and offer reassurance.
    - Listen to music you love.
    - Meditate or engage in another type of meditative practice.
    - Practice a sport you love.
    - Go out for a walk.
    - Take a long, warm shower or bath.
    - Play with a pet.
    - Cuddle.
    - Have a massage.
    
    Some people who experience failure feel self-hatred, mistakenly equating the act of failing with being a failure. 
    Learning how to turn self-criticism into self-compassion is crucial to cope with failure and bounce back with renewed confidence.
    
    The third step is to change your emotional state. If you've dealt with the first and second phase of handling a failure, now you
    
    're probably angry that you failed or you alternate between feeling sad and pissed. Neither state is useful if you want to process the 
    failure because they cloud your judgment with strong emotions that make you unable to look at the failure from a more neutral point of view.
    
    Engage in activities that will help you let off some steam and take your mind off the failure. Staying home and fuming at the failure isn't going to change anything; 
    you need to put some distance between yourself and the failure to be able to learn from it and bounce back.
    
    Create a list of lessons you've learned from your failure. Then, try to find a common thread — one key lesson that will help you change your approach and succeed 
    with the next attempt.
    
    Take your time to identify the key lesson from the failure. It's better to spend a few days more analyzing your failure than to resume working on your goal, 
    only to fail yet again due to the same (unidentified) cause. This step is essential to leverage failure as a valuable tool for your future endeavors.

    If you want to be a leader, the good news is that you can do it. Everyone has the potential, but it isn’t accomplished overnight. It requires perseverance. 
    And you absolutely cannot ignore the Law of Process. Leadership doesn’t develop in a day. It takes a lifetime.
    
    **“A LEADER IS ONE WHO SEES MORE THAN OTHERS SEE, WHO SEES FARTHER THAN OTHERS SEE, AND WHO SEES BEFORE OTHERS DO.”**
    
    **NAVIGATORS DRAW ON PAST EXPERIENCE. EVERY PAST SUCCESS AND FAILURE CAN BE A SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND WISDOM—IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE. 
    SUCCESSES TEACH YOU ABOUT YOURSELF AND WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF DOING WITH YOUR PARTICULAR GIFTS AND TALENTS.**
    
    **PEOPLE BECOME REAL LEADERS BECAUSE OF …**
    1. **CHARACTER—WHO THEY ARE. TRUE LEADERSHIP ALWAYS BEGINS WITH THE INNER PERSON.**
    2. **RELATIONSHIPS—WHO THEY KNOW. YOU’RE A LEADER ONLY IF YOU HAVE FOLLOWERS, AND THAT ALWAYS REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONSHIPS—THE DEEPER THE RELATIONSHIPS, 
    THE STRONGER THE POTENTIAL FOR LEADERSHIP. EACH TIME I ENTERED A NEW LEADERSHIP POSITION.**
    3. **KNOWLEDGE—WHAT THEY KNOW. INFORMATION IS VITAL TO A LEADER. YOU NEED A GRASP OF THE FACTS, AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS INVOLVED, AND A VISION FOR THE FUTURE. 
    KNOWLEDGE ALONE WON’T MAKE SOMEONE A LEADER, BUT WITHOUT IT, HE CAN’T BECOME ONE.**
    4. **INTUITION—WHAT THEY FEEL. LEADERSHIP REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST A COMMAND OF DATA. IT DEMANDS AN ABILITY TO DEAL WITH NUMEROUS INTANGIBLES.**
    5. **EXPERIENCE—WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN. THE GREATER THE CHALLENGES YOU’VE FACED IN THE PAST, THE MORE LIKELY FOLLOWERS ARE TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE. EXPERIENCE DOESN’T GUARANTEE 
    CREDIBILITY, BUT IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO PROVE THAT YOU ARE CAPABLE.**
    6. **PAST SUCCESS—WHAT THEY’VE DONE. NOTHING SPEAKS TO FOLLOWERS LIKE A GOOD TRACK RECORD. WHEN I WENT TO MY FIRST CHURCH, I HAD NO TRACK RECORD.**
    7. **ABILITY—WHAT THEY CAN DO. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR FOLLOWERS IS WHAT A LEADER IS CAPABLE OF. ULTIMATELY.**
    
    **CHARACTER COMMUNICATES CONSISTENCY. LEADERS WITHOUT INNER STRENGTH CAN’T BE COUNTED ON DAY AFTER DAY BECAUSE THEIR ABILITY TO PERFORM CHANGES CONSTANTLY.**
    
    **THE BEST LEADERS READ AND RESPOND.**
    
    **LEADERS ARE READERS OF THEIR SITUATION. IN ALL KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY CAPTURE DETAILS THAT ELUDE OTHERS.**
    
    **LEADERS ARE READERS OF TRENDS. EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS AROUND US DOES SO IN THE CONTEXT OF A BIGGER PICTURE. LEADERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO STEP BACK FROM WHAT’S HAPPENING 
    AT THE MOMENT AND SEE NOT ONLY WHERE THEY AND THEIR PEOPLE HAVE GONE, BUT ALSO WHERE THEY ARE HEADED IN THE FUTURE. IT’S AS IF THEY CAN SMELL CHANGE IN THE WIND.**
    
    **LEADERS ARE READERS OF THEIR RESOURCES. A MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACHIEVERS AND LEADERS IS THE WAY THEY SEE RESOURCES. SUCCESSFUL INDIVIDUALS THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN DO. 
    SUCCESSFUL LEADERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, SEE EVERY SITUATION IN TERMS OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES: MONEY, RAW MATERIALS, TECHNOLOGY AND, MOST IMPORTANT, PEOPLE. THEY NEVER FORGET THAT PEOPLE ARE THEIR GREATEST ASSET.**
    
    **Leadership is really more art than science. The principles of leadership are constant, but the application changes with every leader and every situation.**
    
    **The greatest leaders are able to connect on both levels: with individuals and with an audience.**
    
    **THE TOUGHER THE CHALLENGE, THE GREATER THE CONNECTION.**
    
    **THE LAW OF THE INNER CIRCLE. A LEADER’S POTENTIAL IS DETERMINED BY THOSE CLOSEST TO HIM.**
    1. **POTENTIAL VALUE—THOSE WHO RAISE UP THEMSELVES. THE FIRST ABILITY THAT EVERY LEADER MUST HAVE IS THE ABILITY TO LEAD AND MOTIVATE HIMSELF. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN FOR PEOPLE WITH POTENTIAL.**
    2. **POSITIVE VALUE—THOSE WHO RAISE MORALE IN THE ORGANIZATION.**
    3. **PRODUCTION VALUE—THOSE WHO RAISE UP OTHERS.**
    4. **PROVEN VALUE—THOSE WHO RAISE UP PEOPLE WHO RAISE UP OTHER PEOPLE.**
    
    **THE LAW OF EMPOWERMENT. ONLY SECURE LEADERS GIVE POWER TO OTHERS.**
    
    **DESIRE FOR JOB SECURITY. THE NUMBER ONE ENEMY OF EMPOWERMENT IS THE DESIRE FOR JOB SECURITY.**
    
    THE LAW OF REPRODUCTION
IT TAKES A LEADER TO RAISE UP A LEADER

Why don’t all leaders develop others? There are many reasons. Sometimes they just don’t recognize the tremendous value of developing leaders

Why don’t all leaders develop others? There are many reasons. Sometimes they just don’t recognize the tremendous value of developing leaders

THE ONLY WAY YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OTHER LEADERS IS TO BECOME A LEADER.

WHEN FOLLOWERS LIKE THE LEADER AND THE VISION, THEY WILL GET BEHIND BOTH

GREAT LEADERS FIND A WAY TO WIN
WHEN THE PRESSURE IS ON, GREAT LEADERS ARE AT THEIR BEST. WHATEVER IS INSIDE THEM COMES TO THE SURFACE AND WORKS FOR OR AGAINST THEM. JUST A FEW YEARS AGO

THREE COMPONENTS OF VICTORY
TWO KEYS: PREPARATION AND MOTIVATION
MOMENTUM REALLY IS A LEADER’S BEST FRIEND. SOMETIMES IT’S THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOSING AND WINNING

Reading a situation and knowing what to do are not enough to make you succeed in leadership. Only the right action at the right time will bring success. Anything else exacts a high price. That’s the Law of Timing.

TO ADD GROWTH, LEAD FOLLOWERS—TO MULTIPLY, LEAD LEADERS

To go to the highest level, you have to develop leaders of leaders

THE MOST STABLE COMPANIES HAVE STRONG LEADERS AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE ORGANIZATION. THE ONLY WAY TO DEVELOP SUCH WIDESPREAD LEADERSHIP IS TO MAKE DEVELOPING LEADERS

VALUE TEAM LEADERSHIP ABOVE INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP

    "The secret of good writing is to strip every sentence down to its simplest components. Remove every word that serves no purpose, replace every long word with a shorter one, and eliminate adverbs that merely duplicate the meaning already present in the verb. 
    
    If a sentence is excessively cluttered, the reader may struggle to discern its meaning. In some cases, a poorly constructed sentence can be interpreted in multiple ways. 
    
    Writers must therefore constantly ask themselves: What am I trying to convey? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? 
    
    A clear sentence is not a matter of chance. Very few sentences come out perfectly on the first attempt, or even the third. Remember this during moments of frustration. If you find that writing is challenging, it's because it is.
    
    In various fields, every profession develops its own jargon, often used to obscure meaning from the general public."`

    "Invest in companies that don’t depend on capital spending.
    
    A $20 stock with a $4-per-share cash flow gives you a 20 percent return on cash, which is terrific. And if you find a $20 stock with a sustainable $10-per-share cash flow,
     mortgage your house and buy all the shares you can find.
    
    There’s a detailed note on inventories in the section called 'management’s discussion of earnings' in the annual report. I always check to see if inventories are piling up. 
    With a manufacturer or a retailer, an inventory buildup is usually a bad sign. When inventories grow faster than sales, it’s a red flag.
    
    On the bright side, if a company has been depressed and the inventories are beginning to be depleted, it’s the first evidence that things have turned around.
    
    Every few months it’s worthwhile to recheck the company's story. This may involve reading the latest Value Line or the quarterly report and inquiring about the earnings and 
    whether the earnings are holding up as expected. It may involve checking the stores to see that the merchandise is still attractive, and that there’s an aura of prosperity.
     Have any new cards turned over? With fast growers, especially, you have to ask yourself what will keep them growing.
    
    There are three phases to a growth company’s life: the start-up phase, during which it works out the kinks in the basic business; the rapid expansion phase, 
    during which it moves into new markets; and the mature phase, also known as the saturation phase, when it begins to prepare for the fact that there’s no easy way to 
    continue to expand. Each of these phases may last several years. The first phase is the riskiest for the investor because the success of the enterprise isn’t yet established. 
    The second phase is the safest, and also where the most money is made because the company is growing simply by duplicating its successful formula. 
    The third phase is the most problematic because the company runs into its limitations. Other ways must be found to increase earnings.
    
    **STOCKS IN GENERAL:**
    - The P/E ratio. Is it high or low for this particular company and for similar companies in the same industry.
    - The percentage of institutional ownership. The lower, the better.
    - Whether insiders are buying and whether the company itself is buying back its own shares. Both are positive signs.
    - The record of earnings growth to date and whether the earnings are sporadic or consistent. (The only category where earnings may not be important is in the asset play.)
    - Whether the company has a strong balance sheet or a weak balance sheet (debt-to-equity ratio) and how it’s rated for financial strength.
    
    **SLOW GROWERS:**
    - Since you buy these for the dividends (why else would you own them?), you want to check to see if dividends have always been paid and whether they are routinely raised.
    - When possible, find out what percentage of the earnings are being paid out as dividends. If it’s a low percentage, then the company has a cushion in hard times. 
    It can earn less money and still retain the dividend. If it’s a high percentage, then the dividend is riskier.
    
    **STALWARTS:**
    - These are big companies that aren’t likely to go out of business. The key issue is price, and the P/E ratio will tell you whether you are paying too much.
    - Check for possible diworseifications that may reduce earnings in the future.
    - Check the company’s long-term growth rate and whether it has kept up the same momentum in recent years.
    - If you plan to hold the stock forever, see how the company has fared during previous recessions and market drops.
    
    **ASSET PLAYS:**
    - What’s the value of the assets? Are there any hidden assets?
    - How much debt is there to detract from these assets? (Creditors are first in line.)
    - Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?
    - Is there a raider in the wings to help shareholders reap the benefits of the assets?
    
    Here are some pointers from this section:
    - Understand the nature of the companies you own and the specific reasons for holding the stock. (“It is really going up!” doesn’t count.)
    - By putting your stocks into categories, you’ll have a better idea of what to expect from them.
    - Big companies have small moves, small companies have big moves.
    - Consider the size of a company if you expect it to profit from a specific product.
    - Look for small companies that are already profitable and have proven that their concept can be replicated.
    - Be suspicious of companies with growth rates of 50 to 100 percent a year.
    - Avoid hot stocks in hot industries.
    - Distrust diversifications, which usually turn out to be diworseifications.
    - Long shots almost never pay off.
    - It’s better to miss the first move in a stock and wait to see if a company’s plans are working out.
    - People get incredibly valuable fundamental information from their jobs that may not reach the professionals for months or even years.
    - Separate all stock tips from the tipper, even if the tipper is very smart, very rich, and his or her last tip went up.
    - Some stock tips, especially from an expert in the field, may turn out to be quite valuable. However, people in the paper industry normally give out tips on drug stocks, 
    and people in the health care field never run out of tips on the coming takeovers in the paper industry.
    - Invest in simple companies that appear dull, mundane, out of favor, and haven’t caught the fancy of Wall Street.
    - Moderately fast growers (20 to 25 percent) in non-growth industries are ideal investments.
    - Look for companies with niches.
    - When purchasing depressed stocks in troubled companies, seek out the ones with superior financial positions and avoid the ones with loads of bank debt.
    - Companies that have no debt can’t go bankrupt.
    - Managerial ability may be important, but it’s quite difficult to assess. Base your purchases on the company’s prospects, not on the president’s resume or speaking ability.

    - A lot of money can be made when a troubled company turns around.
    - Carefully consider the price-earnings ratio. If the stock is grossly overpriced, even if everything else goes right, you won’t make any money.
    - Find a story line to follow as a way of monitoring a company’s progress.
    - Look for companies that consistently buy back their own shares.
    - Study the dividend record of a company over the years and also how its earnings have fared in past recessions.
    - Look for companies with little or no institutional ownership.
    - All else being equal, favor companies in which management has a significant personal investment over companies run by people that benefit only from their salaries.
    - Insider buying is a positive sign, especially when several individuals are buying at once.
    - Devote at least an hour a week to investment research. Adding up your dividends and figuring out your gains and losses doesn’t count.
    - Be patient. Watched stock never boils.
    - Buying stocks based on stated book value alone is dangerous and illusory. It’s real value that counts.
    - When in doubt, tune in later.
    - Invest at least as much time and effort in choosing a new stock as you would in choosing a new refrigerator.
    
    If you expect to make 30 percent year after year, you’re more likely to get frustrated at stocks
    
     for defying you, and your impatience may cause you to abandon your investments at precisely the wrong moment. Or worse, you may take unnecessary risks in the pursuit 
     of illusory payoffs. It’s only by sticking to a strategy through good years and bad that you’ll maximize your long-term gains.
    
    There’s no use diversifying into unknown companies just for the sake of diversity. A foolish diversity is the hobgoblin of small investors.
    
    Younger investors with a lifetime of wage-earning ahead of them can afford to take more chances on tenbaggers than can older investors who must live off the income from 
    their investments. Younger investors have more years in which they can experiment and make mistakes before they find the great stocks that make investing careers. 
    The circumstances vary so widely from person to person that any further analysis of this point will have to come from you.
    
    Some people automatically sell the 'winners'—stocks that go up—and hold on to their 'losers'—stocks that go down—which is about as sensible as pulling out the flowers 
    and watering the weeds. Others automatically sell their losers and hold on to their winners, which doesn’t work out much better. Both strategies fail because they’re 
    tied to the current movement of the stock price as an indicator of the company’s fundamental value.
    
    By successfully rotating in and out of several stalwarts for modest gains, you can get the same result as you would with a single big winner: six 30-percent moves 
    compounded equals a fourbagger plus, and six 25-percent moves compounded is nearly a fourbagger.
    
    A stock’s going up or down after you buy it only tells you that there was somebody who was willing to pay more—or less—for the identical merchandise.
    
    This demonstrates that the market, like individual stocks, can move in the opposite direction of the fundamentals over the short term.
    
    Market declines are great opportunities to buy stocks in companies you like. Corrections—Wall Street’s definition of going down a lot—push outstanding companies 
    to bargain prices.
    
    - Different categories of stocks have different risks and rewards.
    - Stock prices often move in opposite directions from the fundamentals, but long term, the direction and sustainability of profits will prevail.
    - Just because the price goes up doesn’t mean you’re right.
    - Just because the price goes down doesn’t mean you’re wrong.
    - Buying a company with mediocre prospects just because the stock is cheap is a losing technique.
    - Selling an outstanding fast grower because its stock seems slightly overpriced is a losing technique.
    - Companies don’t grow for no reason, nor do fast growers stay that way forever.
    - You don’t lose anything by not owning a successful company.
    - When favorable cards turn up, add to your bet, and vice versa.
    - You don’t have to 'kiss all the girls.' I’ve missed my share of tenbaggers and it hasn’t kept me from beating the market."`

    title: 'Oversubscribed',
    body: `When the supply is “one” and there are “two” who want it, then that price keeps going up.
    
    if you want to hire top talent, you need to be
    oversubscribed for top talent. That means that some people need to miss out on
    the job. If you want impactful publicity you need to be oversubscribed for people
    who want the story you have to share, so some news outlets won't get the story.
    If you want to sell products, those products need more buyers than supply can
    allow for – so again, some people will miss out.
    
    You'll also discover that you don't need to create a massive market for yourself
    in order to be oversubscribed
    
    Consistent and repetitive message – This means you need to repeatedly
    state what you do in very clear and credible terms. Don't radically change it
    each time or for each audience. People need to hear something about 7–15
    times before they “get it” and remember it. If you're going to have 5,000
    people “get it” you need to arrive at one way of “showing up” or describing
    what you do and then say it a lot.

    2. Content – People read all the time. They Google stuff, they share stuff,
    they read what their friends are reading, they email links to a friend; then on
    holiday they take a Kindle and read some more! If you haven't got articles,
    blogs, books, reports, videos, podcasts or updates for people to read, then
    it's nearly impossible to become famous for even 500 people.

    3. Commercial ecosystem – After people get to know you, like you and trust
    you, they want to buy from you. Some will want to buy something small for
    £100; some will want to buy something for £1,000 and a small number of
    people will want to spend much more than that with you. This means you
    need a product ecosystem for people to engage with.

    4. Continuity – When people “discover you”, they want to know what went
    on before. So they Google you, look around, piece together your timeline.
    This means you need to have an online profile that shows what you've been
    doing over the last few years. Then they want to stay updated with what
    you're doing in the future. People will want to follow you on Twitter,
    Facebook, YouTube and the like.

    5. Collaboration – As you become famous to 5,000+ people, you'll get
    opportunities to do deals with other people who are famous to a similar
    group. They might want to create a product together, promote an event or
    work on a project. You'll need a good framework for what you say yes to
    
    There are four drivers of
    market imbalances where you'll see more buyers than sellers. These are the four
    ways to achieve this imbalance.
    1. Innovation – You create something new and shiny, that no one else sells.
    There's only one seller (you) and a niche of new buyers who want it. There
    are therefore more buyers than sellers by virtue of the fact there's only one
    supplier and more people who want it.

    2. Relationships – You build such a powerful relationship with buyers that
    they ignore other sellers. There are more buyers than sellers because buyers
    aren't interested in other sellers.

    3. Convenience – You are answering the needs of the market with the most
    frictionless expression of what they want. This is about being in the right
    place, at the right time, with something that meets consumers' unmet
    desires. This creates more buyers than sellers because buyers are reluctant
    to invest time, money and energy finding alternatives.

    4. Price – This occurs when you're able to create an imbalance based on price.
    You've invested into an asset that creates an efficiency others don't have.
    Crucially, you're still able to offer your products at a price that is profitable
    but that price is lower than other suppliers can achieve.
    
    You'll also notice that each one of these positions has an opposite. You can't be
    highly innovative and convenient; it doesn't work because innovation takes time
    to scale. You can't be super cheap and also compete on relationships; it costs
    money to build relationships. So you'll have to choose one main market position
    for your business to focus on
    
    Product innovation: You invest in a new product that people haven't seen
    before, or modify an existing product in a new way
    
    Systems innovation: You deliver an existing product in a new way that
    makes things faster or more reliable
    
    Brand innovation: You make something boring a lot more desirable with a
    new way of packaging it for the market
    
    There is another way to own a relationship with the market. You can become an
    influencer in your field so that people will listen to your advice rather than shop
    around. people have their market listening to their advice.
    
    Become more influential: Improve your ability to enroll others in your ideas and projects.
    
    Become better known: Widen your own personal or your business's appeal
    through media, events, publicity and other brand-building activities
    
    Get deals in place: Once a deal is done, customers stop shopping around.
    Creating lasting agreements with clients gives your business more strength
    and value.
    
    Better distribution: When a business makes something available to its
    buyers with less energy, effort or time required.

    2. Better market information: As more information is made available,
    market leaders give way to market followers. This also occurs when a buyer
    doesn't need to research their options as much.
    
    Automation: When things happen faster or on autopilot. This could be new
    machinery or systems online or offline
    
    The final way to create more buyers than sellers is to bring down the cost of
    production so that you can offer something cheaper than everyone else but still
    make a profit
    
    Invest: Cleverly investing into assets that create a natural barrier to entry
    will allow you to reduce your costs and keep your margins. Owning your
    premises or buying equipment that is expensive to hire can be ways to keep
    prices lower.

    2. Refine: Looking for inefficiencies where there are costs that do not
    increase the value to a paying customer will keep margins wide while prices
    fall.

    3. Systemize: Using systems and technology rather than people is a powerful
    way to keep overheads low and margins high.
    People Don't Buy What Others Want to Sell. They Buy What Others
    Want to Buy
    
    When people feel good about buying from you, they will tell people that they
    bought from you. When they tell people they bought from you, other people will
    want to buy from you too. When people want to buy from you, you're on your
    way to being oversubscribed
    
    But oversubscribed businesses don't think like that. They understand that if you
    treat your clients as aspirational individuals, many more people will aspire to be
    like them too
    
    No one in Singapore needs a Ferrari. It is, in fact, a ridiculous car to own in this
    particular country. There's not a single place on the island that a Ferrari would be
    fun to drive; it's nearly impossible to get a super-car past second gear in
    Singapore. So considering that Singapore is also one of the most expensive
    places to buy a Ferrari (about 4x more than in the UK) why do so many people
    have them?

    Life isn't simple and neither is business. Nothing works on its own; everything
    works together. Gone are the days when providing great value gets you paid
    well. The people who get paid well today are the people who build a

    remarkable ecosystem that delivers a positive experience and keeps people

    If people talk about you in a positive way, your marketing budget reduces to
    zero.
    
    Oversubscribed businesses spend money on their existing customers
    before they spend money on their prospective ones. It seems counter-intuitive –
    but if you get it right, your existing customers go out and do your marketing for
    you.

    let's take a look at the problem you solve for people. High value products and

    1. Save or make money.
    2. Save time or eliminate wastage.
    3. Bring increased emotional benefits.

    Becoming oversubscribed is about finding a market that highly values you, has
    the capacity to pay you, and that you want to serve.
    
    Your goal isn't to tell people why they should be delighted; your goal
    is to watch and see if people ARE delighted after doing business with you. If
    they aren't, then you have a problem – and no amount of explaining why they

    want to grow, you must commit to spending 5–15% of your income on highquality
    training and development so you're always at the cutting edge.”
    
    You now know the capacity of clients you want to achieve in the year ahead in
    order to be oversubscribed. So let's break that number down.
    
    Your business will sell more of its core offering if you produce more productsfor-
    prospects too. It's a simple activity: your job is to create scalable products
    that help to educate or entertain your market. Ideally, you also want to create a
    product-for-prospects that helps you to learn more about your client, too. You
    might want their contact details or to better understand their needs. An elegant
    product-for-prospects will achieve those goals.
    
    Saying yes when you can't deliver sets you up to fail.
    
    After accepting
    more customers than you can handle, you figure that you'll surely find a
    way to look after them – somehow. You'll hire more staff, buy new
    equipment, or outsource to a third party supplier. But those things still take
    up your time and take you away from the care and attention you'd planned
    on giving to your clients. By exceeding your capacity, you run the risk of
    letting down each and every one of your clients – not just the extra few.

    2. People will learn not to take you at your word. If you go over your
    capacity, people will eventually find out and will assume everything you
    say is nothing more than a gimmick. They will assume your special price is
    the normal price, your limited-time offer is available all the time and your
    exclusive deal is for anyone. When you stick to your guns, people learn that
    you mean business – and if they want to access your products and services,
    they'd better take action when you ask them to.

    3. Every person you turn away is a walking advertisement for your
    brand. Have you considered that people very rarely get turned away from
    spending money and they will probably tell quite a few friends when it
    happens to them? They will say, “I tried to pay more, I begged, I negotiated
    and pleaded but they didn't budge and refused to take my money!” That
    story gets around and your business becomes known for it.
    
    Is your brochure worth passing
    on to a friend? Is your service worth tweeting about? Would I take a photo of
    your product and upload it on Facebook?
    
    The real test for your business to pass is whether it is worthy of being talked
    about. Will people speak positively about you after they have purchased? Will
    they share your story? Will they recommend you to their friends? Would a
    customer link to your blog from their website? Is your brochure worth passing
    on to a friend? Is your service worth tweeting about? Would I take a photo of
    your product and upload it on Facebook? Would someone make a YouTube
    video about how wonderfully your staff treated them? Would your staff tell their
    friends they should work for your company? Would a competitor say they want
    to be like you? Would the newspapers write a positive story about you?
    
    To create a high performing team, you need a high performance culture. For a
    small team, culture is about setting a standard for performance and a way of
    interacting that brings out the desired results
    
    You get what you pitch for and you're always pitching: Words have
    power. You can speak into existence almost any outcome. Be careful what
    you talk about, because you could be “pitching into existence”.
    
    Five core strengths make someone a Key Person of Influence, and like any other
    skills, anyone can learn and develop these strengths:

    1. Pitching: The ability to clearly communicate your message in a way that
    influences people to become involved in your projects. You'll need pitching
    skills to get your team together, and to procure funding, partners and sales.

    2. Publishing: The ability to write compelling blogs, articles, reports and
    content that people can read, relate to and share with others. Being
    oversubscribed requires you to spread a message, and today that means the
    message needs to be in print and online.

    3. Productizing: The ability to turn valuable insights into products (or
    “productized service-offerings”) that can scale. Hot products are at the
    centre of every oversubscribed business.

    4. Profile: The ability to take ideas “above the noise” and to gain visibility for
    yourself and your cause. It also means that this Key Person of Influence has
    an existing profile that they can leverage.

    5. Partnerships: The ability to form strategic alliances with other valuable
    people who can make things happen faster.
    
    
    Research suggests that if the average score is less than 7 out of 10, you've got no
    chance at growing your business or becoming profitable in the long term. If you
    score highly, your business has a future.
    This is why your head of operations needs to live or die by this number. They
    need to go to bed thinking about it, wake up thinking about it and spend all day
    doing what they can to improve it.
    
    1. Build a better product – A brilliant product will return a great result for
    Net Promoter Score. If it solves a problem better than anyone expected,
    then it's going to be hot. A great ops person will always want to improve the
    product, and it will never be good enough for them. If you let them tinker,
    they will go above and beyond good judgment to make the product better.

    2. Build a better system of delivery – A great product becomes too
    expensive if the system of delivery is inefficient. The value you offer is the
    end result; but inefficiency in how you deliver that pushes costs up, and
    passes them along to customers or shareholders. Either way, the business is
    at risk if the systems are sloppy.

    3. Change the target market – If you try to sell a Ferrari to family of five,
    you will have a low NPS score. The product is world-class, but it's not right
    for a large family; they would be a lot happier with a sedan. Likewise, if
    your product is presented to the wrong market, you'll score low on the NPS.
    The ops person needs to give feedback to the marketing person about the
    types of people who are loving the product – and those who aren't.

    4. Change the expectations – Expectations are created by marketing and
    sales people, product packaging, and product delivery or through the client
    on boarding process. A good ops person is always on the lookout for the
    expectations that have been set for the clients. They either need to deliver
    upon those expectations, or make sure people aren't setting those
    expectations too high in the first place. For example, if a sales person is
    making preposterous claims in order to win a sale, the ops person needs to
    nip it in the bud
    
    Business isn't inherently fun. A lot of people experience pain, humiliation,
    heartbreak and despair as a result of being in business. It can be lonely,
    frustrating and can suck the life out of you as it drags on over the years
    
    
    The dream people are sold is that business is a barrel of laughs. Being an
    entrepreneur is a path to freedom and adventure. I can tell you that most business
    people I meet aren't living the dream. But the successful ones I know have
    something in common: they are oversubscribed.

    They have more opportunities than they know what to do with. They have more
    customers than they can handle. They have investors lining up. They can pick
    and choose their next adventure with all the options open. They enjoy the stress
    of being spoilt for choice rather than being out of options.

    Being oversubscribed is the gateway to enjoying business. Get yourself into that
    position and surf the wave.`

    body: `I am that stranger who has nothing to give you and who is telling you to look
    inside. Not inside any box, as in the parable, but somewhere even closer: inside
    yourself.
    
    Just because you can solve a crossword puzzle or build an atom bomb doesn’t
    mean that you use your mind. Just as dogs love to chew bones, the mind loves to
    get its teeth into problems. That’s why it does crossword puzzles and builds atom
    bombs. You have no interest in either. Let me ask you this: can you be free of
    your mind whenever you want to? Have you found the “off” button?
    
    Then the mind is using you. You are unconsciously identified with it, so you
    don’t even know that you are its slave. It’s almost as if you were possessed
    without knowing it, and so you take the possessing entity to be yourself
    
    
    The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the possessing entity
    
    Instead of “watching the thinker,” you can also create a gap in the mind stream
    simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now. Just become
    intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to
    do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a
    gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is
    the essence of meditation.
    
    In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that
    normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention, so that it
    becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the
    stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every
    movement, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your
    hands, pay attention to all the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the
    sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent of the soap,
    and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a
    few seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but
    powerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you can
    measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within.
    
    As it is, I would say about 80 to 90

    I don’t want to lose my ability to analyze and discriminate. I wouldn’t mind
    learning to think more clearly, in a more focused way, but I don’t want to lose my
    mind. The gift of thought is the most precious thing we have. Without it, we
    would just be another species of animal.
    
    So observing our emotions is as important as observing our thoughts?
    
    Yes. Make it a habit to ask yourself: What’s going on inside me at this moment?
    That question will point you in the right direction. But don’t analyze, just watch.
    Focus your attention within. Feel the energy of the emotion. If there is no
    emotion present, take your attention more deeply into the inner energy field of
    your body. It is the doorway into Being

    Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know
    that it is the pain-body. Accept that it is there. Don’t think about it — don’t let
    the feeling turn into thinking. Don’t judge or analyze. Don’t make an identity for
    yourself out of it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is
    happening inside you. Become aware not only of the emotional pain but also of
    “the one who observes,” the silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the
    power of your own conscious presence.

    But if you are fortunate enough
    to find someone who is intensely conscious, if you can be with them and join
    them in the state of presence, that can be helpful and will accelerate things. In
    this way, your own light will quickly grow stronger. When
    
    As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you
    cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what
    you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled. Since the ego is a derived
    sense of self, it needs to identify with external things. It needs to be both
    defended and fed constantly.
    
    All negativity is caused by an accumulation of psychological time and denial of
    the present. Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry — all forms of fear — are
    caused by too much future, and not enough presence. Guilt, regret, resentment,
    grievances, sadness, bitterness, and all forms of nonforgiveness are caused by
    too much past, and not enough presence
    
    .” Ultimately, this is not about solving your problems. It’s about
    realizing that there are no problems. Only situations — to be dealt with now, or
    to be left alone and accepted as part of the “isness” of the present moment until
    they change or can be dealt with.
    
    If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily
    mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change
    the how. “How” is always more important than “what.” See if you can give
    much more attention to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve
    through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This
    implies that you also completely accept what is, because you cannot give your
    full attention to something and at the same time resist it.
    
    Make it a habit to monitor your mental-emotional state through self-observation.
    “Am I at ease at this moment?” is a good question to ask yourself frequently. Or
    you can ask: “What’s going on inside me at this moment?” Be at least as
    interested in what goes on inside you as what happens outside. If you get the
    inside right, the outside will fall into place. Primary reality is within, secondary
    reality without. But don’t answer these questions immediately. Direct your
    attention inward. Have a look inside yourself. What kind of thoughts is your
    mind producing? What do you feel? Direct your attention into the body. Is there
    any tension? Once you detect that there is a low level of unease, the background
    static, see in what way you are avoiding, resisting, or denying life — by denying
    the Now. There are many ways in which people unconsciously resist the present
    moment.
    
    Your unhappiness is
    polluting not only your own inner being and those around you but also the
    collective human psyche of which you are an inseparable part. The pollution of
    the planet is only an outward reflection of an inner psychic pollution: millions of
    unconscious individuals not taking responsibility for their inner space.
    
    Then accept the consequences. No excuses. No negativity. No psychic pollution.
    Keep your inner space clear
    
    Any action is often better than no action, especially if you have been stuck in an
    unhappy situation for a long time. If it is a mistake, at least you learn something,
    in which case it’s no longer a mistake. If you remain stuck, you learn nothing. Is
    fear preventing you from taking action
    
    What is the power of Now?
    None other than the power of your presence, your consciousness liberated from
    thought forms.
    
    What is essential is your conscious
    presence. That dissolves the past.
    
    The past cannot survive in
    your presence. It can only survive in your absence.
    
    If they do not
    free themselves from their mind in time, they will be destroyed by it. They will
    experience increasing confusion, conflict, violence, illness, despair, madness.
    Egoic mind has become like a sinking ship. If you don’t get off, you will go
    down with it. The collective egoic mind is the most dangerously insane and
    destructive entity ever to inhabit this planet.
    
    Attention is like a beam of light — the focused
    power of your consciousness that transmutes everything into itself.
    
    There is nothing you can ever do or attain that will get you closer to salvation
    than it is at this moment. This may be hard to grasp for a mind accustomed to
    thinking that everything worthwhile is in the future. Nor can anything that you
    ever did or that was done to you in the past prevent you from saying yes to what
    is and taking your attention deeply into the Now. You cannot do this in the
    future. You do it now or not at all
    
    
    Yes. Happiness depends on conditions being perceived as positive; inner peace
    does not.
    Is it not possible to attract only positive conditions into our life? If our attitude
    and our thinking are always positive, we would manifest only positive events and
    situations, wouldn’t we?
    
    The same condition that was
    good yesterday or last year has suddenly or gradually turned into bad. The same
    condition that made you happy then makes you unhappy.
    
    The Buddha taught that even your happiness is dukkha

    When buying property for the purpose of investing, the most important factor
    to consider is the location. Unlike other investments, real estate is dramatically
    affected by the condition of the immediate area surrounding the property and
    other local factors.
    
    Several factors need to be considered when assessing the value of real estate.
    This includes the age and condition of the property, improvements that have
    been made, recent sales in the neighbourhood, changes to zoning regulations,
    etc. You have to look at the potential income a house can produce and how it

    Let's Create & Track Your Own Financial
    Freedom Plan Those who plan do better than
    those who do not plan even though they may
    not be able to stick to their plan.
    
    Step 1:
    Establish your Cash Flow Calculate your cash inflow
    (what you get every month) and outflow (what you
    spend every month).
    Step 2 : Identify your Assets, Liabilities and Net
    Worth~50
    Calculate your Net Worth as of now, counting all possible assets and liabilities.
    
    Step 3 : Create a High Level Financial Freedom Plan
    Identify your Special Life Events, estimate and assess
    the size of your nest egg, which will be adequate to
    sustain your expenses and taxes, as well as take care of
    inflation for the rest of your life. Establish the time
    needed to build this nest egg, starting today.
    
    Step 4 : Create a Detailed Financial Freedom Plan
    Create a month on month portfolio plan that ties up
    with your high level financial freedom plan in Step 3.
    This should allow you to track your journey month on

    Step 6 : Track your Financial Freedom Plan monthly
    Track the monthly nest egg target against the actual
    nest egg value on a regular basis and make sure that
    you stay on track.
    Step 7 : Tune / Rebalance your Portfolio every year Use
    trends based on the last year and previous years to see
    which part of the portfolio is giving best returns, and

    each milestone during your journey with your family
    and friends and give yourself a pat on the back.
    These are the eight simple steps that can elevate your life forever.
    
    Role of Expense Calculation in Financial Freedom The
    idea of establishing your cash flow is to fundamentally
    understand your current standard of living. The
    purpose is also to prepare this data as a feed for your
    purpose is also to prepare this data as a feed for your
    Financial Freedom Plan. Your Financial Freedom
    corpus should be big enough to take care of your
    standard of living (or Expenses) for the rest of your life,
    after adjusting for inflation.
    
    Establish Cash Outflow This process of tracking your/
    cash outflow is extremely interesting and eye opening. It
    will make you think about your money. Who cares more
    about your money than you? It is time to face the truth
    and do so honestly. This is essential. This is the
    foundation step to your entire financial dream.
    
    Track your expenses on a daily basis. Scientific studies have proven that a
    daily track of expenses can reduce your expenses by as much as 15%.
    If for any reason, you cannot track them daily, track them at the earliest
    possible interval. The longer the interval, higher are the chances that you
    will miss out tracking some of the expenses.
    Involve your family in this activity. I have realised that giving the
    ownership of this activity to your children helps you a lot.
    You must keep tracking your expenses for the rest of your life. Expense
    Tracking should be a habit, as is bathing or brushing your teeth. You should
    feel something missing if you have not tracked your expenses on a specific
    day. We may start with inconsistencies but we must keep improving. You
    will continue to get surprised as you keep doing it every day every month
    every year.
    
    Role of Saving Potential in Financial Freedom Our
    saving potential is the fuel during our journey towards
    financial freedom. Knowing our saving potential allows
    us to calculate the speed at which we can undergo this
    journey. The more is our saving potential, the faster we
    can approach our financial freedom
    
    Role of Assets in Financial Freedom?
    Assets happen to be the most critical cog in the wheel of financial freedom. You
    become financially free when your assets grow big enough to feed your
    expenses, after taking care of inflation, for the rest of your life, without you
    actively pumping any more funds into it. This essentially means that your asset
    base becomes self funding in nature.
    
    Assets minus liabilities give you your financial net worth.
    
    Step 3: Create a High Level Financial Freedom Plan
    "Plan the work and work the plan" was our success
    mantra as project managers in the software industry.
    What it essentially means is that the first step is to
    plan the work before starting to execute the work. In
    our daily life, and similarly with financial planning,
    we are often tempted to get started fast and not
    "waste" our time on planning.
    
    But it has been proven time and again that a good plan is half the battle won.
    Have a clear plan, stick to it and strive hard to 'achieve' or 'over-achieve' the
    plan.
    Such a plan will also make you think of innovative ways to meet your
    milestones in the plan. You can use any project planning tool to create your
    financial plan or, as I did it, you can use a simple Excel spreadsheet to plan your
    financial freedom and then use the same to track the actual progress as compared
    to the plan.
    
    vHigh Level Financial Independence Plan Planning
    starts at a high level and needs certain key inputs from
    the previous sections to proceed.
    Creating a high level plan essentially needs the following mandatory inputs:
    1. Start Point (your current net worth) (calculated in Step 2)
    2. End Point (amount of money needed to become financially free i.e. your
    target net worth)
    3. Speed of Journey (Average Saving Potential – calculated in Step 1)
    4. Time to reach from the starting point to the end point (calculated based on
    above 3 points)
    
    Freedom start year
    This is the year in which you attain your financial freedom
    
    Annual Portfolio Return on investments (post freedom)
    This is the return that you can expect on your nest egg every year once
    you reach financial freedom
    
    
    At the minimum, we must track our journey towards financial freedom
    on a monthly basis
    
    What is my monthly nest egg target this month?
    Where have I reached compared to the target?
    How am I performing? Will I be financially free by the target date?
    What is my exact investment in each asset class of the portfolio?
    
    Comparing the actual nest egg amount with the planned nest egg
    amount for each month gives you an idea whether you are on track
    with your plan or not.
    
    I do not recommend Gold to be more than 10% of your overall
    portfolio ever. It is just a hedge against inflation and good diversification
    when markets are down.
    
    This is the big league investment. My personal recommendation for each one of
    you would be to wait for at least 40–50 months after you start your journey
    before you enter this league of investors. Remember, we are talking about real
    estate as an investment and not about the house you live in
    
    But since this investment involves a huge amount of money and lacks
    liquidity, it is recommended to be kept for the last leg of your financial freedom
    journey or after you have achieved financial freedom.
    
    Always
    keep in mind that no one can achieve anything of
    one's own efforts only. There are innumerable
    sacrifices (heard or unheard) that go in making one
    person successful. It is time to honour those who
    helped you relentlessly.
    
    Never give up. You only get one life. Go for it!
    
    KISS stands for 'Keep It Simple, Silly.' Financial terms and jargon can appear to
    be complex and intimidating at times. However, let me assure you once again
    that you do not need anything more than a logical mind to figure out what is
    happening around you, and then take appropriate decisions of your own to learn
    and earn as you progress.
    
    Your goals, your dreams, your passion is something that can take you to the
    future and help you take informed decisions before you go on a spending spree.`

    The Future of Education
    1. Academic Education
    Professional Education
    Financial Education
    
    The world of tomorrow
    belongs to those who can process information, see relationships and trends, and
    be agile and responsive to change as the world changes.
    
    During the Agrarian Age and Industrial Age, being older was an asset.
    Older meant wiser. In the Information Age, being older is a liability
    
    Motivate: The word comes from Latin "motere" meaning
    "to move."
    
    True financial education must include lessons on taxes, who pays them, and
    why some people are offered tax breaks.
    
    In the words of Albert Einstein:
    "Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in
    school."
    
    "If a father has a weak financial statement, the entire family
    suffers. If a business has a weak financial statement, the employees suffer.
    And if country has a weak financial statement, the citizens suffer.

    and empower; they can be devastate and demoralize. The magic of words if that
    they are free—and we have the power to choose the words we use.
    
    The poor work for ordinary income.

    The middle class work primarily for portfolio income. This includes
    capital gains, increases in value on their home, stock market investments,
    and retirement accounts.

    The rich work for passive income. This means cash flowing in, whether
    they work or not.
    
    
    The primary skills I learned from rich dad were the skills for the B and I
    quadrants. The basic skills are:
    Know how to raise capital
    Know how to lead people
    Know how to design businesses
    Know how to use debt to make more money
    
    A person is limited only by his
    or her imagination.

    lots of practice—before doing the real thing.
    
    education and practice—
    lots of practice—before doing the real thing.
    
    Leadership skills are important for entrepreneurs.
    
    An Information-Age World
    In this Information Age, the emperor of education truly does have no clothes.
    And, thanks to the innovations of modern-day entrepreneurs, quality education
    can be affordable and accessible. And, like the era when Henry Ford made the
    automobile affordable for almost everyone, today’s true capitalists are doing that
    with education.
    
    I know many experts will say that it is not good to scare kids, but this is not
    about scaring them. It is about preparing them for the future.
    
    "Problems can make you smarter. Problems can also make
    you poorer. It’s your choice."
    
    The three early windows of learning are:
    First window: Birth to age 12
    Second window: Age 12 to age 24
    Third window: Age 24 to age 36
    
    If a person is described as "right-brain dominant," the person is more artistic,
    creative, and more free-flowing in their approach to life. If a person is described
    as "left-brain dominant," the person is more bookish, less creative, and more
    linear. The left brain is where speech, reading, writing, and math skills and
    aptitudes are said to come from. Traditional schools believe left-brain-dominant
    students are smart.
    
    So there is some truth to the saying, "You can’t teach an old dog new tricks."
    The older you get, the more learning slows, and the harder it becomes harder to
    build new neural pathways
    
    A schoolteacher may teach your child for a semester or a year, but a parent is a
    teacher for life. The consistency and stability that a parent brings to a child’s life
    as that life-long teacher—throughout all the windows of learning—reiterates
    why parents are a child’s most important teachers.
    
    I can still hear my rich dad saying, "If going to school made you rich, then
    schoolteachers would be millionaires."
    
    As Einstein once said, "Simplicity is genius."
    
    Learn from the experience, grow from it, and move on.
    
    "Thinking is the hardest work there is…which is probably the reason why so few
    people engage in it."
    
    "Each quadrant is a different classroom. Each classroom teaches
    different subjects, develops different skills, and requires different teachers."
    
    One day, a group of his employees got together to
    unionize his hotel and restaurant operations. He backed them down saying, "I’ll
    shut down the business and all of you will lose your jobs if you unionize. I can
    start a new business and I don’t need the money, but you need your jobs. I’ve
    been fair to you and your families. All I ask is for you to be fair to me and my
    family." When the vote was taken, the union lost.
    
    If they have a secure attitude towards
    learning, they may value learning over money.
    
    the dropouts’ average net worth was much greater
    than that of their college-graduate peers
    
    Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a
    different result.
    It is insanity to say to your child, "Go to school and get a job," when jobs are
    being shipped overseas or replaced by advances in technology.
    It is insanity to say, "Work hard," when the harder you work, to earn more
    money, the more taxes you pay.
    It is insanity to say, "Save money," when money is no longer money…but debt,
    an IOU from the taxpayers.
    It is insanity to say, "Your house is an asset," when it is really a liability.
    It is insanity to say, "Invest for the long term in the stock market," when
    professional investment houses are using multi-million dollar computers to
    invest for the short-term, often in and out in milli-seconds for HFT, HighFrequency
    Trading, against amateur investors…in some cases their own clients.
    You may as well go to Las Vegas.
    
    "We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we
    created them."

    3. "Freedom is more important than security."

    5. "I want to find out how far I can go in life."
    
    "teaching pigs to sing" he saw it as a lose lose
    proposition: "It wastes your time. And it annoys the pig."

    Teaching a person with poor or middle class person’s context is a waste of
    time…and it does annoy them."
    
    Just as the Cone of Learning illustrates, it was a process of
    simulation, before doing the real thing.
    Simulation in the world of sports is known as practice. In the theater, simulation
    is known as rehearsals.
    
    Emotional intelligence is essential for long-term success. In practice it may
    mean:
    Going to the gym rather than staying in bed
    Taking financial education classes even if you don’t want to
    Being kind, when others aren’t
    Going for a walk, rather than eating
    Not having a drink, even if you want one
    Telling the truth, even if it makes you look bad
    Making a phone call you don’t want to make
    Volunteering even when you are busy
    Controlling your temper instead of losing it
    Turning the TV off and spending time with your family, especially if your
    favorite show is on
    
    Notice that the B-I Triangle is made up of the 8 Integrities of a business. They
    are:
    1. Mission
    2. Leadership
    3. Team
    4. Product
    5. Legal
    6. Systems
    7. Communications
    
    Why Most Entrepreneurs Fail
    1. The entrepreneur does not have all 8 integrities in place. For example,
    most new entrepreneurs focus on product. They may have a great product, but
    are likely deficient in some or all of the other 7 integrities.

    2. The entrepreneur is a mono-professional. The saying "Birds of a feather
    flock together" applies here. For example, attorneys get together with other
    attorneys to form a business such as a law practice. Or techies get together with
    other techies to form a web company. Again, they may be smart professionals,
    but they will lack professional strength at the other 7 integrities.

    3. The entrepreneur lacks a sense of mission. You will recall that, among the
    Seven Intelligences, emotional intelligence and a sense of mission is essential in
    carrying an entrepreneur through the ups and downs of starting a business.
    Almost all notable entrepreneurs faced trials and tribulations that would destroy
    mere mortals.
    
    "Success has many parents, but failure is an orphan."
    
    1. Morality: you don’t have to cheat people to be rich
    2. Creativity: tap into your genius
    3. Spontaneity: live without the fear of making mistakes
    4. Problem solving: focus on solutions
    5. Lack of prejudice: having a wider context on life
    6. Acceptance of Fact: not afraid to face the truth
    
    In school, you are intelligent if your right answers agree with your teacher’s
    right answers. If your answers agree with the teacher’s answers, you are an "A"
    student.
    
    "You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.
    You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot
    help the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. You cannot
    further the brotherhood of man by encouraging class hatred. You
    cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot keep out of
    trouble by spending more than you earn. You cannot build character
    and courage by taking away man’s initiative and independence. You
    cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and
    should do for themselves."
    
    When something bad happens, you have 3 choices which are
    1) You can let it define you.
    2) You can let it destroy you.
    3) You can let it strengthen you.`

    however, may have an inability to accurately gauge their emotions

    but if you are prone to seek out risk, you might want to focus on the potential consequences of loss. 
    It will stop you from making trades that may decimate your account balance.
   
   Novice traders are infamous for needing to be right. This natural, human tendency is so powerful that novice traders engage in unproductive trading behaviors to avoid admitting that they are wrong. 
   They might hold on to a losing trade
   
   you will make more progress on some days than others, but what is most important is that you never give up and spend every day working toward your goal.
   
   There are too many issues to attend to, and without a wealth of experience, you are bound to make mistakes. Making a specific action plan while trading has clear benefits.
    Scientific research illustrates how action plans help people achieve their goals. Dr. Peter Gollwitzer, Professor of Psychology at New York University, has 
    conducted several studies that demonstrate the benefits of making specific plans that outline when, where, and how to perform an action.
   
   In a review of relevant studies on making specific action plans, Dr. Gollwitzer argues that plans allow people to more easily remember what to do specifically. 
   They don’t waste time trying to recall what it is they are going to do. They have decided what to do, and when, 
   beforehand and have little trouble doing what they had planned. Second, research has shown that people respond quickly when they have a plan to follow.
   
   Third, when people have a plan, they can more easily ignore interruptions and distractions. They are able to more easily focus on the task at hand, maintaining self-control. 
   Action plans are especially useful when trying to respond during high-stress situations, such as during a day when the market action is hard to pin down. 
   
    it’s hard to predict every possible adverse event. 
    no matter how unlikely, but you must be ready for the worst. You should be psychologically prepared for big setbacks and be ready to take them in stride should they occur.
    Regret is so incredibly painful at times that many traders avoid even putting on a trade for fear of having to face the regret of loss later. It’s as
     if the subsequent regret after making a loss is more disturbing to the psyche than the actual loss itself.

   There are a few simple ways to cope with regret. The most important way to cope with regret is to accept the fact that regret is an emotion that you’ll be likely to experience as a trader. 
   You’re going to make losing trades, and if you don’t take proper precautions, you will feel regret. It’s not useful to delude yourself into thinking that you can avoid regret completely
   it’s also important to remember that a single losing trade (or even a few losing trades) doesn’t mean that you have poor trading skills; it may just be a run of bad luck. 
   
    The outcome of the trade should not influence the positive view you have of yourself as a person.`

    (1) you don't need to know what's going to happen next to make money;

    (3) every moment is unique, meaning every edge and outcome is truly a unique experience.
    
    How do we remain disciplined, focused, and
    confident in the face of constant uncertainty? When you have learned how to "think" like a trader, that's
    exactly what you'll be able to do. Learning how to redefine your trading activities in a way that allows
    you to completely accept the risk is the key to thinking like a successful trader. Learning to accept the
    risk is a trading skill—the most important skill you can learn.
    
    The best traders aren't afraid. They aren't afraid because they have developed attitudes that
    give them the greatest degree of mental flexibility to flow in and out of trades based on what the market
    is telling them about the possibilities from its perspective.
    
    In trading, no one (except yourself) is going to force you to decide in advance what your risk is.
    
    For everyone else, defining the
    risk in advance would force you to confront the reality that each trade has a probable outcome, meaning
    that it could be a loser. Consistent losers do almost anything to avoid accepting the reality that, no
    matter how good a trade looks, it could lose.
    
    The hard reality of trading is that, if you want to create consistency, you have to start from the premise
    that no matter what the outcome, you are completely responsible. This is a level of responsibility few
    people have aspired to before they decide to become traders
    
    To some degree, all of us have learned or developed techniques to make
    the external environment conform to our mental (interior) environment
    
    The tools you will use to create this new version of yourself are your willingness and desire to learn,
    fueled by your passion to be successful
    
    The way to take maximum advantage of a situation where you are being offered unlimited
    opportunities to do something for yourself is to get into the flow.
    
    If you stop fighting the
    market, which in effect means you stop fighting yourself, you'll be amazed at how quickly you will
    recognize exactly what you need to learn, and how quickly you will learn it. Taking responsibility is
    the cornerstone of a winning attitude. CH
    
     Accepting the risk means accepting the consequences of your trades without emotional discomfort or fear when at the moment you
    perceive the risk, you simultaneously feel discomfort and fear? In other words, how do you remain confident and pain-free when you are absolutely certain you can be proved wrong, lose money, miss
    out, or leave money on the table?
    
    If your goal is to be able to trade like the professionals, you must be able to see the market from an
    objective perspective, without distortion. You must be able to act without resistance or hesitation, but
    with the appropriate amount of positive restraint to counteract the negative effects of overconfidence or
    euphoria.
    
    If there is such a thing as a secret to the nature of trading, this is it: At the very core of one's ability 
    1) to trade without fear or overconfidence, 
    2) perceive what the market is offering from its perspective, 
    3) stay completely focused in the "now moment opportunity flow," and 
    4) spontaneously enter the "zone," it is a strong virtually unshakeable belief in an uncertain outcome with an edge in your favor. The best
    traders have evolved to the point where they believe, without a shred of doubt or internal conflict, that
    "anything can happen."
    
    who have learned to think in probabilities are confident of their overall success, because they commit
    themselves to taking every trade that conforms to their definition of an edge.
    
    On the
    other hand, if you believe that all you need to know is:
    1. the odds are in your favor before you put on a trade;
    2. how much it's going to cost to find out if the trade is going to work;
    3. you don't need to know what's going to happen next to make money on that trade; and
    4. anything can happen;
    
    How Beliefs Shape Our Lives
    1. They manage our perception and interpretation of environmental information in a way that is
    consistent with what we believe.
    2. They create our expectations. Keep in mind that an expectation is a belief projected into some future
    moment. Since we can't expect something we don't know about, we could also say that an expectation
    is what we know projected into some future moment.
    3. Anything we decide to do or any outward expression of behavior will be consistent with what we
    believe.
    4. Finally, our beliefs shape how we feel about the results of our actions.
    
    1. Build the self-trust necessary to operate in an unlimited environment.
    2. Learn to flawlessly execute a trading system.
    3. Train your mind to think in probabilities (the five fundamental truths).
    4. Create a strong, unshakeable belief in your consistency as a trader
    
    1. I objectively identify my edges.
    2. I predefine the risk of every trade.
    3. I completely accept risk or I am willing to let go of the trade.
    4. I act on my edges without reservation or hesitation.
    5. I pay myself as the market makes money available to me.
    6. I continually monitor my susceptibility for making errors.
    7. I understand the absolute necessity of these principles of consistent success and, therefore, I
    never violate them.
    
    1. you have an edge that genuinely puts the odds of success in your favor;
    2. you can think about trading in the appropriate manner (the five fundamental truths); and
    3. you can do everything you need to do over a series of trades. Then, like the casinos, you will own the
    game and be a consistent winner
    
    Why do casinos make consistent money on an event that has a random outcome? Because they know
    that over a series of events, the odds are in their favor. They also know that to realize the benefits of the
    favorable odds, they have to participate in every event. They can't engage in a process of picking and
    choosing which hand of blackjack, spin of the roulette wheel, or roll of the dice they are going to
    participate in, by trying to predict in advance the outcome of each of these individual events. If

    Happiness is invaluable
    
    And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing when you have enough
    
    What is the lesson for entrepreneurs here? I have no idea, because risk and luck are so hard to pin down
    
    The best (and worst) managers drive their employees as hard as they can.
    “The customer is always right” and “customers don’t know what they want” are both accepted business wisdom
    
    
    But realize that not all success is due to hard work, and not all poverty is due to laziness
    
    Reputation is invaluable. Freedom and independence are invaluable
    
    Being loved by those who you want to love you is invaluable.
    Happiness is invaluable
    
    And your best shot at keeping these things is knowing when
    it’s time to stop taking risks that might harm them. Knowing
    when you have enough
    
    Capitalism is hard. But part of the reason this happens is because
    getting money and keeping money are two different skills.
    Getting money requires taking risks, being optimistic, and putting
    yourself out there.
    
    A wise old owl lived in an oak,
    The more he saw the less he spoke,
    The less he spoke, the more he heard,
    Why aren’t we all like that wise old bird?
    
    No one—not a single person out of a thousand—said that to be
    happy you should try to work as hard as you can to make
    money to buy the things you want.

    No one—not a single person—said it’s important to be at least
    as wealthy as the people around you, and if you have more
    than they do it’s real success.

    No one—not a single person—said you should choose your
    work based on your desired future earning power.
    
    It’s a subtle recognition that people generally aspire to be
    respected and admired by others, and using money to buy
    fancy things may bring less of it than you imagine. If respect
    and admiration are your goal, be careful how you seek it.
    Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect
    than horsepower ever will
    
    SPENDING MONEY TO SHOW PEOPLE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IS THE FASTEST WAY TO HAVE LESS MONEY.
    
    NO ONE IS IMPRESSED BY YOUR POSSESSION AS MUCH AS YOU ARE.
    
    HISTORY IS THE STUDY OF CHANGE IRONICALLY USED AS A MAP OF THE FUTURE.
    
    Fifteen billion people were born in the 19th and 20th centuries. But
    try to imagine how different the global economy—and the whole
    world—would be today if just seven of them never existed:
    Adolf Hitler
    Joseph Stalin
    Mao Zedong
    Gavrilo Princip
    Thomas Edison
    Bill Gates
    Martin Luther
    
    What we know about investment cycles and startup failure rates is not a deep base of history to learn from, because the way companies are funded
    today is such a new historical paradigm.
    
    THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF EVERY PLAN IS PLANNING ON YOUR PLAN NOT GOING ACCORDING TO YOUR PLAN
    
    The quicker it’s done, the sooner you can get back to
    compounding
    
    Charlie Munger says the first rule of compounding is to never interrupt it unnecessarily.
    
    Disneyland tickets cost $100. But you get an awesome day with your kids you’ll never forget. Last year more than 18 million people
    thought that fee was worth paying
    
    This same thing applies to business, where it takes years to realize how important a product or company is, but failures
    can happen overnight.
    
    When planning we focus on what we want to do and can do, neglecting the plans and skills of others whose decisions might
    affect our outcomes
    
    wrong: the outcome of a start-up depends as much on the achievements of its competitors and on changes in the market as on its own
    efforts. However, entrepreneurs naturally focus on what they know best—their plans and actions and the most immediate
    threats and opportunities, such as the availability of funding. They know less about their competitors and therefore find it
    natural to imagine a future in which the competition plays little part.
    
    Manage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night
    
    different goals and desires. There is no single right answer; just the answer that works for you.
    
    Charlie Munger once said “I did not intend to get rich. I just wanted to get independent
    
    Simple investment strategies can work great as long as they capture the few things that are important to that strategy’s success    `

    body: `No matter what you learn, what
    strategy or tactic you employ,
    success comes as the result of
    the Compound Effect
    
    The Compound Effect is the operator’s manual that teaches you
    how to own the system, how to control it, master it, and shape
    it to your needs and desires. Once you do, there is nothing you
    can’t obtain or achieve
    
    The Compound Effect is based on a principle I’ve used in my
    own life and training; that is, your decisions shape your destiny.
    The future is what you make of it. Little, everyday decisions will
    either take you to the life you desire or to disaster by default.
    
    If your
    competitor is smarter, more talented, or experienced, you just
    need to work three or four times as hard. You can still beat them!”
    No matter what the challenge, he taught me to make up in hard

    Success, Old School
    The most challenging aspect of the Compound Effect is that we
    have to keep working away for a while, consistently and effi ciently,
    before we can begin to see the payoff. 
    
    Think about it. Everything in your life exists because you
    fi rst made a choice about something. Choices are at the root of
    every one of your results
    
    
    Have you ever been bitten by an elephant? How about
    a mosquito? It’s the little things in life that will bite you.
    Occasionally, we see big mistakes threaten to destroy a career or
    reputation in an instant
    
    We are all self-made men and women, but only the successful
    take credit for it. I was eighteen when I was introduced to the
    idea of personal responsibility at a seminar, and the concept
    completely transformed my life.
    
    answered, “Yes, of course, we are all lucky. If you
    live in a free society, you are lucky. Luck surrounds us every day;
    we are constantly having lucky things happen to us, whether you
    
    The (Complete) Formula for Getting Lucky:
    Preparation (personal growth) +
    Attitude (belief/mindset) +
    Opportunity (a good thing coming your way) +
    Action (doing something about it) =
    Luck
    
    “It’s a funny thing; the more I practice, the luckier I get.”
    
    Attitude: This is where luck evades most people, and where
    Sir Richard is spot-on with his belief that luck is all around us.
    It’s simply a matter of seeing situations, conversations, and
    circumstances as fortuitous. You cannot see what you don’t look
    for, and you cannot look for what you don’t believe in.
    
    I now challenge you to do the same. No matter what has
    happened to you, take complete responsibility for it—good or
    bad, victory or defeat. Own it. My mentor Jim Rohn said, “The
    day you graduate from childhood to adulthood is the day you
    take full responsibility for your life.”
    
    Step by step, day by day, your choices
    will shape your actions until they become habits, where practice
    makes them permanent.
    
    Losing is a habit. So is winning. Now let’s work on permanently
    instilling winning habits into your life.
    
    Aristotle wrote, “We are what we repeatedly do
    
    I’ve met and worked with many great achievers, CEOs, and
    “superstars,” and I can tell you they all share one common
    trait—they all have good habits. That’s not to say they don’t
    have bad habits; they do. But not many.
    
    A daily routine built on
    good habits is the difference that separates the most successful
    amongst us from everyone else. And
    
    People are either motivated by something they want or
    something they don’t want. Love is a powerfully motivating
    force. But so is hate.
    
    When you defi ne your goals, you give your brain something
    new to look for and focus on. It’s as if you’re giving your mind a
    new set of eyes from which to see all the people, circumstances,
    conversations, resources, ideas, and creativity surrounding you.
    With this new perspective (an inner itinerary), your mind proceeds
    to match up on the outside what you want most on the inside—
    your goal.
    
    Find the line of expectation and then exceed it. Even when it
    comes to the small stuff—or maybe especially then
    
    Whatever your expectations are
    about the next Apple product launch, Jobs always has a little (or
    a lot of) something extra to WOW you

    body: `SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION

    (Your success as a negotiator depends on choosing the
    appropriate behavior Doing so not only gives you control of
    the negotiation but also enhances your self-esteem.

    1. Has this happened before? (You react more emo
    tionally when a situation repeats.)
    
    2. What kind of commilment exists in the relation
    ship? (When the commitment isn't equal, you
    generally become more upset.)
    
    3. What else is bothering me? (Outside factors often
    contribute to your conflict and emotional response.
    
    A negative factor may hurt the negotiation.)
    
    What will I lose if l don't get what I want? (Place
    the problem inside the larger scheme of life and
    get some perspective on it. You may see that you
    n survive the outcome if you don't get what
    you want.)
    
    THREE POSSIBLE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS you have in a lifetime are dependence ,independence and inter deppendence
    
    interdependent behaviours include honesty openness confrontation acceptance and empowerment of oneself and others ina a negotiating situation.
    
    interdependent behaviour calls for acceptance of others as they are unconditionally rather than making judgements based on their performance
    
    I Will upport you in any way i can so you can make the best decesions on this job.. the employer is saying . i care about you ,you are incredible with me . 
    
    i support you and will work with you to accomplish our goal. how can you use empowerment successfully in negotiations, 
    
    follow three steps
    make the decesion to emower
    communicate empowerment
    recognise that feelings stem from behavior
    
    choice in negotiations you don't let differences be-come the issue; instead you look toward what you have in common. You find the common ground and negotiate from that perspective
    
    2: Knowledge. Gain, as much information as you can about another person or situation so you're more prepared to negotiate
    
    Practice
    practice helps you improve the process of communicating and negotiating with others. The skills required to be a good commue nicator and negotiator take 
    ongoing practice so you'll' have a fine-tuned technique at your fingertips
    
    involvement
    invite the ideas and openions of others when you negotiate with them. when you ask people to get involved they feel imp and valued . 
    this increases theor desire to negotiate to become an effective negotiator , you need to develop your ability to res[ect others differences.
    
    its not what you say but how; you say it that makes a difference. Nonverbal behavior directly affects the negotiation process. 
    people "listen" to body language. When body language and words, don't match, people place more value on body language. 
    Negotiations can fail or succeed based on the message you send through body language
    
    body language includes:
     A. Voice pitch (how high or low the voice sounds)
     Intonation (emphasis placed on certaia words).
     Gestures (the way your hands, antis, and legs move).
    eye contact (looking at someone directly or indirectly)
    proximity(how close to someone you stand or sit)
    facial expression(a smile or frown)
    
    body language communicates
    how much power you believe you have in a situation
    how much you like someone
    how responsive you are to someone
    
    using soften as a negotiating technique.
    s = smile - you send a message that you care abt them . smiling helps to erase negative feelings towards others.
    o = open - open body postures
    f = forward lean -when you lean forward others instead of away you communicate interest and willingness to learn/
    t = touch - a hand shake a squeeze  a hug or a pat on the back all indicate you care about someoneThe handahake
    communicates interest and responsiveness in an
    acceptable way) When appropriate, a pat on the
    back may accompany the handshake
    e= Eye contact - When you make eye contact
    with others, you say you are trustworthy, believ
    able, and responsive
    Always make eye contact while you negotiate
    n=node - nodding your head shows you are listening and processing the conversation.
    
    ways to communicate effectively when negotiating
    be clean 
    whenever you negotiate make sure the message you send is the one that you intented
    strive to make your verbak and nonverbal behaviour  send the same message.

    Find out what other successful people do over and over, and then do
    the same things that they do. By the Law of Cause and Effect, if you do what

    Work all the time you work. When you go to work, work.
    Do not play with your friends, check your e-mail every five minutes, read the
    newspaper, or take care of personal business.
    
    Keep focused on your most important tasks. Don’t waste time
    
    Use the ABCDE method to categorize your tasks. Apply the idea of
    “consequences” to each activity. In time management, something that is
    important has serious potential consequences. Something that is unimportant has
    low or no consequences at all. Think before you act.

    A = Must do—there are serious potential consequences for doing or not
    doing this task. Put an A next to each of the most important items on
    your list.

    B = Should do—there are mild consequences for doing or not doing this,
    but it is not as important as your A tasks.
    
    C = Nice to do—but there are no consequences one way or another if you
    have a coffee break, chat with a co-worker, or check your social
    media.
    
    D = Delegate—you should delegate everything that you possibly can,
    even tasks that you like and enjoy, to free up your time for doing only
    those few things that you can do best and are most important.
    
    E = Eliminate—deliberately stop doing all low-value/no-value tasks and
    activities.
    
    Well Begun Is Half-Done
    The habit of starting and completing your most important task first thing each
    morning will transform your life
    
    Successful people practice positive thinking most of the time. As a result, they
    are happier, more genial, more popular and derive more real pleasure from life
    than the average person.
    
    The key to self-esteem, self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-respect is for you
    to accept 100 percent responsibility for everything you are and all that you will
    become in life.
    
    Your main job in life, if you want to become a totally positive person, is to let
    the past go and turn toward the sunshine.
    
    By blaming someone else for something, you enable
    that person to manipulate and control your emotions—at long distance. You give
    him power and control over your own happiness by your refusal to forgive him
    and to let him go. And in most cases, he doesn’t even know how much control
    he has over your happiness and well-being.
    
    1. Rethinking: This requires that you stop the clock, take a time-out, and stand
    back to look at your situation objectively. Ask yourself three questions:
    What am I trying to do?
    How am I trying to do it?
    Could there be a better way
    
    2. Reevaluating: Practice zero-based thinking, and consider the possibilities of
    doing things completely differently.
    
    3. Reorganizing: Look for ways to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of
    your operations by moving people and resources around and by deploying
    them in different ways
    
    4. Restructuring: This involves moving your people and resources into the 20
    percent of activities that can account for 80 percent of your results.
    
    5. Reengineering: What-If Thinking
    One of the most powerful questions you can ask in triggering creativity is,
    “What if?” Each time you ask this question, you break the bonds of limited
    thinking that may keep you working in a narrow area, and you open your mind
    to more and more possibilities.
    What-if thinking is considered the breakthrough concept that made Federal
    Express one of the most successful companies in the world. It started by asking,
    “What if it was possible to deliver a letter overnight, anywhere in the country?
    
    When President John F. Kennedy asked the scientist in charge of the
    American space program, Wernher von Braun, what it would take to put a man
    on the moon and bring him back safely, von Braun replied simply, “The will to
    do it.”
    
    The entrepreneur says, “I enable people to drive wherever they want in
    comfort and safety.
    
    Entrepreneurial thinking requires that you think about the customer all the time.
    You continually seek new, different, better, faster, and cheaper ways to serve
    customers and give them more and more of what they really want and need.
    Your ability to think like an entrepreneur rather than an employee will do
    more to liberate your full potential in your career than any other single factor. It
    might even make you rich.
    
    “Compounding is the most powerful force in the universe.”
    
    “Someday I’ll.”
    “Someday I’ll save my money rather than spending it all.”
    “Someday I’ll upgrade my knowledge and skills.”
    “Someday I’ll work harder and make myself more valuable.”
    “Someday I’ll get out of debt.”
    They end up living on “Someday I’ll” for most of their lives.
    
    Here’s the solution. When you decide to become wealthy, don’t tell anyone.
    Keep it a secret. Go to work on your goal privately, and only tell people when
    they see your life improving and ask you how you did it.
    
    6. THEY STOP LEARNING AND GROWING
    To achieve something you’ve never achieved before, you must learn and practice
    something that you’ve never done before. The rungs on the ladder to financial
    success are knowledge and skill.
    
    Steve Siebold, author of the book How Rich People Think, said, “If you want
    to make a lot of money, find a big problem that a lot of people have, and solve it
    in a new way.”
    
    Something-for-Something Thinking Versus Something-for-Nothing
    Thinking
    
    Successful people have good habits that lead to happy, productive, and
    financially successful lives. Poor people have poor habits, or no habits at all, that
    lead to the opposite. Fortunately, all habits are learnable with practice and
    repetition. You can learn any habit or skill you need to learn to achieve any goal
    you can set for yourself.
    The only real question is, “How badly do you want it?”
    
    New habits are difficult to practice and learn at first, but soon they become
    automatic and easy. Soon it becomes easier to practice your new habit than to
    fall back into your old ways of doing things
    
    “Before you can have something more and different, you must become
    someone more and different.
    
    Success is not an accident. Failure is not an accident either. You are where you
    are and what you are because of yourself, because of your own thinking and
    behavior.
    If you want your future to be better in any area, you must first change and
    improve your thinking along the lines described in this book. You must make
    new choices and better decisions.
    Fortunately, everything you are today, you have learned from early childhood
    as the result of input and practice. At any time, you can decide to learn new
    ideas, practice new behaviors, and get different results.`

    just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.”
    Aristotle
    
    if you log on to Facebook and other social media platforms every time you open your
    laptop, switching on your laptop is a reminder for your social media behavior.
    
    If you know which bad habit you want to change, you can look for positive
    alternatives and use them to fulfill your need for that reward
    
    Nurturing discipline becomes easier when you have a strong internal program
    comprised of healthy habits. When you engage in one good habit after another,
    particularly those geared towards the pursuit of your goal, you focus on what
    matters instead of distractions.
    
    Write down all your bad habits and distractions, as well as their associated
    reminders, routines, and rewards. Observe yourself for a few days so that you
    can get a better hang of what triggers different habits and why you engage in
    them.

    Create plans for different bad habits, but remember to work on one bad
    habit at a time.
    
    “Momentum is really a leader’s best friend. Sometimes, it’s the only
    difference between winning and losing.”
    
    The truth is that we are all leaders of our lives and mind, and we can only lead
    better if we build momentum. Once you create the momentum to do so, you
    continuously lift heavier weights every day
    
    Momentum means slowly accelerating your speed along the journey and
    refining your mental strength. Building momentum helps you gain pace so
    that you can push yourself forward, inch-by-inch, day-by-day.
    
    Whatever goal(s) you may have, to achieve it, you need to put in the extra
effort

you have to prioritize your tasks, manage your
temptations, avoid distractions, work hard, and stay focused on the end goal,
all of which are only possible when you have self-discipline

self-discipline is primarily about doing what you need to do at this
moment and successfully fighting the urge to do what you wish to do. Whims
and wishes are a part of our life, so are temptations

When you practice self-control, you become invincible and gain the power to
achieve anything you focus your mind on consistently

The habit loop refers to the cycle followed by the formation of all habits. It
consists of 3 R’s, namely the Reminder, Routine, and the Reward

When you engage in that routine, you feel a certain way. Continuing with the
earlier example of using social media, when you use Facebook and other social
media platforms, you are likely to feel happy or validated after posting your
pictures online and getting good comments.

The feeling is your reward; once you enjoy the reward that comes from
engaging in this particular habit, you start to feed on it.

Create plans for different bad habits, but remember to work on one bad
habit at a time. Working on one habit at a time makes it easier to settle into
the routine and work on one problem at a time without burdening and
overwhelming yourself.

Here is how you can create your plan. Set a deadline and starting date
Go through the starting and ending date of the goal you decided to pursue as
discussed in an earlier section.

Think of the goal, your personality, the environment you work in, and
probable contingencies you may face during the journey. Write all that down
and then analyze the start and end date associated with the goal. If you think
you need more time to complete the goal or need to push back the starting
date until you feel more ready, do so.

For every milestone, identify the tasks you need to do along with details
such as time, how to do it, precautions, triggers you need to avoid, and so
on

“Momentum is really a leader’s best friend. Sometimes, it’s the only
difference between winning and losing.”
John Calvin Maxwell

If you want to build momentum and
continually build your willpower, identify the 20% of the most important and
high priority tasks related to your goal that when engaged in, instantly boost
your productivity. Identify those tasks and brainstorm different ways to
execute them.

    —Bruce Barton
    
    With higher levels of self-confidence, you would be far more effective in
    dealing with difficult people and situations. You would be a far better negotiator
    and be able to ask for, and get, better prices, terms, and conditions in everything
    you bought and sold.
    
    With greater self-confidence, with an unshakable belief in yourself, nothing
    would be impossible for you. More than anything else, you would feel terrific
    
    The world is full of people who are not happy with their results, and yet they
    continue to do the same things, think the same thoughts, say the same things, and
    take the same actions, every day, and they are amazed that they continue to get
    the same negative effects.
    
    True happiness and success comes from living your life in harmony with the
    laws that govern your being
    
    The world is full of people who are not happy with their results, and yet they
    continue to do the same things, think the same thoughts, say the same things, and
    take the same actions, every day, and they are amazed that they continue to get
    the same negative effects.
    
    Order of Values Forces You to Choose
    
    I have known businessmen who put career success ahead of their families in
    their order of priority. When they had to choose one or the other, they regularly
    chose their work over spending time with their spouse and children. As a result,
    both the marriages and the careers have run into serious trouble.
    
    Set Peace of Mind as Your Highest Principle
    
    Your Values Are Only Expressed in Your Actions
    
    I have known businessmen who put career success ahead of their families in
    their order of priority. When they had to choose one or the other, they regularly
    chose their work over spending time with their spouse and children. As a result,
    both the marriages and the careers have run into serious trouble.
    
    Your Values Are Only Expressed in
    Your Actions
    
    The keys to developing the unshakable self-confidence that will make
    everything else possible for you are self-control, self-mastery, and selfdiscipline.
    Self-confidence can come directly, by behaving in a self-confident manner,
    
    “Happiness is a condition. It is not something that is achieved by pursuing it directly, but rather comes as a
    result of our engaging in purposeful activities.”
    
    if we pursue happiness directly, it includes us. However, if we get
    busy doing something that is really important to us and begin to make real progress in the direction of our dreams and aspirations, we find ourselves feeling very happy indeed
    
    Clear goals bring clear results. Because your level of self-confidence is directly tied to how
    effective you feel you are in achieving your goals, it is very important that you
    know exactly what it is you want and that you think of nothing else.
    
    “Nothing is, but thinking makes it so.”
    
    The Four Cs of Inner Confidence
    You can develop this kind of belief, this inner confidence, by developing what I
    call “the four Cs.”
    
    1. Clarity: Decide exactly what it is you want to accomplish and exactly the
    kind of person you wish to become.
    
    2. Conviction: Develop the unshakable belief that you can do anything that
    you can put your mind to.
    
    3. Commitment: Resolve to do whatever is necessary; develop the
    willingness to pay the price, in advance, for any success you desire.
    
    4. Consistency: Resolve to work on your goals every day, morning, noon,
    and night, until they are accomplished.
    
    3. Ask yourself what you would do if you learned today that you only had
    six months to live. If you had no limitations, how would you spend your last
    six months on earth? This is another way of asking, “What is really
    important to you?” Who would you want to spend time with?
    What would you want to accomplish? What would you like to leave behind?
    In other words, what do you truly value? What are the things that really give
    meaning and purpose to your life?
    
    6. Look at your health. Describe what perfect health and physical fitness
    means to you, and then make out a plan to achieve that level of fitness
    
    7. Define the kind of person that you would most like to become, both
    personally and professionally. Then, work out a plan of personal and
    professional development that will enable you to learn and grow and become
    the kind of person you most admire and would most like to be. Remember,
    as Goethe said, “Before you can have something, you must first be
    something.”
    
    Categorize Your Goals
    Once you have written out your goals, divide them into the different areas of
    your life that are important. There are basically six divisions that most people
    use, but you can have more or fewer.
    1. Financial and material goals.
    2. Family and personal goals.
    3. Self-improvement and educational goals.
    4. Spiritual goals.
    5. Health and fitness goals.
    6. Social and community goals.
    To perform at your very best, your life must be in balance. This means that
    you need to have goals in each area so that you are moving progressively
    forward on something that is important to you all the time.
    
    The mental discipline to set your goals and to sort
    them out, and to decide on your chief aim or your major definite purpose, is the
    starting point of individual greatness.
    
    Begin each day by
    sitting down with this notebook and writing out your main goals in the present
    tense, as though they were already a reality.
    
    Use strong, definite words like, “I earn,” “I achieve,” or “I am.” You can write
    other things in this notebook if you like, but the most important action is that you
    take five minutes each day to write and rewrite your major goals, without
    referring back to what you wrote yesterday.
    Hand writing your goals is called a “psychoneuromotor activity.”
    
    By rewriting your goals every day, they become clearer and stronger and take
    on a power of their own.
    
    8. Do something every day, seven days per week on your major goal.
    Resolve to persist on this goal until you succeed, no matter how hard it
    becomes or how much time it takes
    
    This process of setting and achieving one big goal will build your selfconfidence
    to the point where you will become unstoppable for the rest of your
    life.
    
    In other words, the outer limit of your envelope, or the outer limit of your
    potential, is not fixed in time or space, like that of an aircraft. Your limits are
    determined solely by your own beliefs and by your own confidence in what you
    think is possible for you
    
    In every study of success and self-confidence, in every situation in which a
    person enjoys high levels of self-esteem, self-respect, and personal pride, we
    
    The wonderful thing is that the highest paid people in America, and
    worldwide, are often working at jobs that they enjoy so much that they hate to go
    home at night, and the lowest paid people are invariably found at jobs they
    dislike, in which they are just going through the motions.
    
    Theodore Roosevelt said, “Do
    what you can, with what you have, where you are.
    
    You could be excellent at six out of seven of your key result areas, but your
    weakness in the seventh area can hold you back for years.
    
    1. Invest 3 percent of your income back into yourself. Spend 3 percent of
    what you earn on personal research and development, on upgrading your
    skills and abilities, and on becoming better at performing the most important
    
    All Skills Are Learnable
    
    1. Make a decision today to become excellent at what you do. Set it as a
    goal, make a plan, and work on it every day.

    2. Identify the jobs or parts of your job that you most enjoy, and then seek a
    way to more and more of those jobs.
    
    3. Identify those jobs in your career that have been easy to learn and which
    are easy to do, and look for ways to do more of them, more of the time
    
    5. Identify the one skill that, if you were excellent at it consistently, would
    have the greatest positive impact on your career.
    
    6. Develop a continuous learning plan for yourself, and dedicate yourself
    toward getting better and better at what you do.
    
    7. Identify the most important result, or results, for which you are paid, and
    resolve to get more and better of those results each day
    
    Your job is to achieve the same level of confidence and belief as that possessed
    by that businessman. The world will largely accept you at your own estimation.
    It is yourself that you have to convince, before you can convince anyone else
    
    Here is an affirmation that has been very helpful to me. I repeat it over and
    over until it becomes automatic, in almost every situation. When something goes
    wrong, I immediately catch myself by saying, “Every situation is a positive
    situation if viewed as an opportunity for growth and self-mastery.”
    
    If it’s a problem, it’s amenable to a solution. There is something that you can
    do to change it. If you are not happy with the situation, it is up to you to go and
    do whatever you can to resolve it.
    
    Your goal is to be happy, confident, and optimistic. The way that you achieve
    this is by making these positive responses so automatic that you remain
    predominantly happy, confident, and optimistic, no matter what happens.
    
    Positive Self-Talk
    Your Interpretive Style
    Talk to Yourself Positively
    Unlimited Potential
    Your potential is unlimited using affirmations. Remember that affirmations are a
    way of programming your subconscious mind. By repeated affirmations, you can
    instill within your mind powerful, positive commands that will eventually
    determine your automatic thoughts, feelings, and responses
    
    The law of accumulation reminds us that everything counts. Every positive
    step you take is moving you toward building a great life for yourself. Every
    positive word or thought or image is deepening your belief and increasing your
    confidence in your ability to achieve wonderful things
    
    4. Resolve today to accept complete responsibility for your life, for
    everything you are today, and for everything that you will ever be in the
    future.
    
    Weaknesses are an inevitable and unavoidable fact of life
    
    The law of concentration also says that all great success in life comes from
    single-minded, focused concentration on doing one thing or a few things
    extremely well. Success comes from staying at a particular task, the most
    valuable and important task you could be doing, until you succeed.
    
    dedicated, concentrated effort. However, there is little to be gained by digging
    determinedly, if you’re digging in the wrong place. As Benjamin Tregoe,
    management consultant, said, “The very worst use of time is to do well what
    need not be done at all.”
    
    The key to becoming a fully functioning, fully integrated personality, the basic
    factors underlying self-confidence, is for you to become more aware of who you
    really are, and what you really want in life.
    
    List All Your Current Skills and
    Capabilities
    The first exercise for you is to write down a list of everything that you do on a
    regular basis. Write out all your roles and the parts you play, from the time you
    get up in the morning, until the time you go to bed at night. If you play sports or
    exercise with various equipment,
    A second exercise that is very helpful in learning more about yourself, and one
    that has been a turning point in the lives of many people, is to turn to someone
    close to you and ask him or her what they think you should do with your life
    
    The second type of motivation is that of power. A person with a strong power
    orientation is one who enjoys getting things done through others. Power in this
    context refers to being able to influence and coordinate the activities of others
    over a period of time to complete a complex task. A coach of a sports team or a
    manager at work who really enjoys what he or she is doing would be a person
    who is most motivated by this kind of power or influence.
    
    Play Well on the Team
    The first quality they identified was the ability to perform well as a member of a
    team, and the ability to put together teams to accomplish common objectives. All
    the business and the interpersonal skills that make a person valuable to an
    organization seem to be demonstrated in a team setting.
    
    Almost everything that happens to you is determined by your responses to the
    ups and downs of daily life.
    
    The starting point of eliminating this fear is for you to accept and realize that
    no success is possible without failure. All success is preceded by failure, usually
    great failure, repeated over a long period of time.

    Napoleon Hill wrote, “When defeat comes, accept it as a signal that your plans
    are not sound: rebuild those plans and set sail once more toward your coveted
    goal.”
    
    Dale Carnegie wrote, “The successful man will profit from his mistakes and
    try again in a different way.”
    
    “Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not;
    nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not;
    unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of
    educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
    
    The Four Ds of Success and Self-
    Confidence
    How do you infuse your whole life with the kind of self-confidence that makes
    everything possible for you? The answer is contained in what I call the four Ds,
    which determine success in anything you really want to accomplish.
    The first D is desire. You must really want to become a totally self-confident
    human being. You must build up your desire by thinking about it and talking
    
    about it, and working on it all the time. Your desire must become so intense that
    it overrides your fears of failure, rejection, and inferiority, and it becomes the
    dominant emotion governing your behaviors. Intense desire is the starting point
    of all personality modification and goal attainment.

    The second D is decision. You must make a do-or-die decision that you will go
    to work on yourself and keep at it until you achieve the kind of self-confidence
    that enables you to do, be, and say whatever you want. You must burn your
    mental bridges. Many people want things but they never make the clear,
    unequivocal decision that they are going to do what it takes to get them.
    
    The third D is determination. Once you have started to make significant
    changes in the way you act, your internal gyroscope will try to take over and
    bring you back into your comfort zone, into your old ways of acting.
    Sometimes, progress will be slow, and, often, you will see no progress at all.
    Nonetheless, you must persist in the positive and constructive behaviors that you
    know will lead to making you into the kind of person you wish to become. Your
    determination must be as unshakable as the self-confidence you desire.
    
    The fourth D is discipline. Underlying and surrounding all great achievement
    in life is the quality of self-discipline. This is the ability to make yourself do
    what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not. Every
    practice of self-discipline strengthens your discipline in every other area of your
    life
    
    Socrates once said that “We only learn something by dialoguing about it.” You
    only really understand something to the degree to which you can discuss it with
    others or explain it to a third party. Your ability to translate your experience into
    words, which only comes through thinking and reflection, is essential for your
    growth and wisdom and common sense

    Speak Up with Confidence and

    In your conversations with others, be sure to speak up clearly, and express
    yourself openly and honestly. In one-on-one conversations, in meetings, or with
    groups, the more competent you are at speaking out, the more competent and
    more confident you will feel.
    
    The real difference between the winners and losers in life is the difference
    between taking action and making excuses. It is between the people who do and
    the people who talk about doing. It is between the movers and shakers and those

    When you set a goal, your brain opens up a task list.
    Whenever you are near things that can help you achieve those goals, your brain fires
    up your instincts to signal to get that goal completed. Let me give you an example
    
    The counting distracts you from your excuses and focuses your mind on moving in a new direction.
    
    When you physically move instead of stopping to think, your physiology changes and your mind falls in line
    
    The problem was very clear. It was me. I was holding myself back, five seconds at a time.
    
    The more that you believe that you are in control of
    your life, your actions and your future, the happier and more successful you’ll be.
    
    
    There’s nothing more powerful than the feeling of confidence and pride you
    gain when you keep trudging forward, face life’s challenges head on, and push
    yourself to change for the better.

    Physical movement is the most important part of my Rule, too, because when
    you move your physiology changes and your mind follows.
    
    You can feel uncertain and be ready. You can be afraid and do it anyway. You
    can fear rejection and still go for it.
    
    The difference between people who make their dreams come true and those of
    us who don’t is just one thing: the courage to start and the discipline to keep going.
    
    Change your decisions and you’ll change your life. And what will change your
    decisions more than anything? Courage.
    
    Change your decisions and you’ll change your life. And what will change your
    decisions more than anything? Courage.

    Dr. King was pushed into the spotlight by his peers. Rosa pushed herself. They
    both experienced the power of a push. It’s a moment when your instincts, values,
    and goals align, and you move so quickly you don’t have time or a valid reason to
    stop yourself.
    
    Courage is a birthright. It is inside each and every one of us. You were
    born with it and you can tap into it anytime you want. It’s not a matter of
    confidence, education, status, personality, or profession. It’s simply a matter of
    knowing how to find it when you need it. And when you need it, you’ll probably be
    alone
    
    After all, courage is just a push.
    
    When you push yourself, you may not change the world, the laws, or spark a
    civil rights movement but I can guarantee you’ll change something equally as
    important—you’ll change yourself
    
    There is only one YOU.
    And there will never be another
    one.
    That’s your power.
    
    the people we admire most needed to be pushed through their fears,
    excuses, and feelings, just like you and me
    
    There is no right time. There is only right now. You get one life. This is it. And
    it’s not going to begin again. It’s up to you to push yourself to make the most of it
    and the time to do it is right now.
    
    You Validate Your Ideas By Pursuing Them
    
    You can feel uncertain and be ready. You can be afraid and do it anyway. You
    can fear rejection and still go for it.
    
    The difference between people who make their dreams come true and those of
    us who don’t is just one thing: the courage to start and the discipline to keep going.
    
    The moment that you realize your feelings are the problem, you now have the
    ability to beat them.
    
    According to neuroscientist Antonio Damasio, it’s our
    feelings that decide for us 95% of the time. You feel before you think. You feel
    before you act. As Damasio puts it, human beings are “feeling machines that think”
    not “thinking machines that feel.” And that’s how you ultimately make decisions—
    based on how you feel.
    
    If you can’t get yourself out of bed, then you’ll never be able to pursue all of
    the other changes that you want to make in your life. And if you take that simple
    step of taking control of your mornings, you’ll catalyze a chain of events that leads
    to change everywhere.
    
    Productivity can be boiled down to one word—FOCUS. There are two types
    of focus you need to master productivity: First the ability to manage
    distractions so that you can focus moment-to-moment on the task at hand, and
    second, the skill of focusing on what’s truly important to you in the big picture, so
    you don’t waste your day on stupid stuff
    
    being addicted to your phone, texting, and answering emails is a distraction…but
    stopping it feels impossible.
    
    First you must decide that distractions are not good. Interruptions of any sort
    are the kiss of death for your productivity

    Your mind will allow your body to calm down because it

    that empowers you. That

    If you can enrich your self-confidence, passion, and connection with people, your life will transform in ways that you
    thought you could only dream of.

    a result, the more confident that you will become
    
    doing things that scare you actually make you more
    confident. If you have the courage to take action, your confidence will follow.
    Every time you push yourself to speak when you’re nervous, act when you’re afraid,
    or get to the gym when you don’t feel like it, you realize that you can rely on
    yourself to get anything done. From this belief in your personal abilities flows your
    confidence

    Consumer Analysis
    Market Analysis
    Review of the Competition and Self
    Review of the Distribution Channels
    Development of a “Preliminary” Marketing Mix
    Evaluation of the Economics
    Revision and Extension of Steps 1–6 until a consistent plan emerges
    
    This seven-step marketing process is comprehensive, and MBAs will often refer to more abbreviated ones, such as STP 
    (segment, target, position), or the four C’s of marketing (consumer behavior, company analysis, competitor analysis, context), but the methodology presented here covers it all.
    
    The steps of the buying process explained:
    Awareness. (Interest, Problem Recognition). “I might need something.” 
    At some point a person will realize a need, like the need to use soap. Advertising may trigger that need. Prestige products such as designer clothes and fragrances trigger desire. 
    They meet emotional needs such as love and group acceptance. Head & Shoulders preys on the fear of a loss of love and group acceptance. You need to ask yourself,
    “How do consumers become aware of my product?” “Where are my targets likely to be exposed to my message?”
    
    The conversion of a low-involvement product to a high-involvement product can make a simple commodity product stand out against an undifferentiated field of competitors. 
    There are four generic ways in which this can be accomplished.
    
    Link Product to a High-Involvement Issue. Linking Procter & Gamble’s Puritan no-cholesterol cooking oil to a wife’s fear of a husband’s heart attack is a classic example of an advertising ploy.
    
    Use Involving Advertising. If the advertising creates a value-expressive message about the product or service, then a product can become important. Such messages link values,
    such as social status and love, instead of promoting physical product attributes to differentiate the product from the competition. 
    Pepsi tries to link being modern and youthful with its products by using singers in elaborate commercials to sell its soda.
    
    Change the Importance of Product Benefits. Products as well as services provide a variety of benefits. 
    If through marketing action a benefit can be raised to a heightened level of importance, buyers are likely to become more involved. The beer wars of the 1980s made
    
    Related to involvement is the level of purchase planning. Is the purchase planned or an impulse buy? High-involvement products are usually planned, 
    while impulse products are bought on the spur of the moment. If a purchase is planned, then a buyer is likely to seek information. If not, the proximity of the product to the need is important. 
    Snack foods are an example of impulse buying. Midday hunger leads to the nearest junk food.
    
    There are four major variables used in segmenting consumer markets:
    Geographic
    Demographic
    Psychographic
    Behavioral
    Geographic Segmentation. Divides the market by country, state, region, county, and city. The federal census lists 310 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs) 
    to define the major geographic population centers of the United States. Arbitron, a large media research firm, has defined a similar measure to capture the 210 major television markets of the country, 
    called Areas of Dominant Influence (ADIs). A. C. Nielsen, a competitor, has a similar measure called Designated Market Areas (DMAs).
    Demographic Segmentation. Divides a population based on the following measurable variables to reach a homogeneous group of people:
    Age —Different generations’ different wants and needs Sex—Gender use and buying patterns Income—The ability to purchase
    
    Marital Status—Family needs Family Life Cycle—Starting out, empty nesters, etc. Education/Occupation—An indication of the sophistication of the consumer Ethnicity, Religion, and Race—Particular tastes and preferences
    Psychographic Segmentation. Divides the market by psychological differences:
    Lifestyle—Activities, interests, and opinions
    Personality—Conservative, risk-taking, status-seeking, compulsive, ambitious, authoritarian, gregarious. (People may have different hot buttons that advertising can try to trigger.)
    Psychographic segmentation is difficult. Personality variables are tougher to identify and quantify than demographics, but they can be valuable.
    Behavioral Segmentation. Divides the market by observable purchase behaviors:
    Usage—Amount of use, manner of use, benefits sought Purchase Occasion—Gift, vacation, seasonal, etc. Brand Loyalty—Loyalty to one product indicates
    receptiveness to others
    Responsiveness to Price and Promotion—Some groups respond to special marketing efforts more than others. Housewives use more coupons than single professional women.
    Marketers must not only select the “right” group of variables but also decide how many to use. The correct number of “useful” variables will identify the most accessible and receptive target, not
    
    What is the relevant market? Where is the product in its product life cycle? What are the key competitive factors in the industry?
    What is the relevant market?
    The easiest mistake to make is to believe that your relevant market includes the total sales of your product’s category.
    
    There are five major key competitive factors that constitute the battleground in most industries:
    Quality
    Price
    Advertising
    Research and Development
    Service
    
    In the fast food industry, for example, intensive advertising and promotion are key. In industries providing raw materials to others, price and service are key. In my investigation of the coffee industry, 
    I found price and quality to be the basis of competition. 
    When developing a marketing plan, you may want to try to change the basis of competition to one that favors your firm, but the key underlying competitive factors cannot be ignored.
    
    How does your SWOT Compare to Your
    Competitor’s SWOT
    
    What is your company good at and what is the competition
    good at?
    Distribution (Frito-Lay)
    New Product Development and Introduction (3M)
    Advertising (Absolut vodka)
    Who are we in the marketplace?
    Market Size and Relative Market Share
    Financial Position
    Historical Performance and Reputation
    What are our resources versus those of the competition?
    People
    Technology, Research
    Sales Forces
    Cash
    Trade Relations
    Manufacturing
    
    The companies with larger market shares relative to their competition usually enjoy higher profits. Larger competitors can produce more cheaply per unit because they can spread their costs over more units.
    
    Own a word in the consumer’s mind. If you establish one benefit in the consumer’s mind, the consumer may attribute other positives as well to your product. FedEx means “overnight delivery.” 
    Only one company can own a word, and it is tough to change it once it’s established.

    2.Positioning begins with the product’s name. The name should be descriptive, to establish the main benefit in the consumer’s mind. Draino opens clogged drains.
    
    3. If you have a unique new product, use a new name. Instead of using the name Apple Mini Mac, Apple chose the iPod name for their new music player.
    
    4. The easiest way to own a word is to be first. Consumers tend to stick with products that work for them. Kleenex cleans runny noses.
    
    5.Don’t stray from your message; “reinforce the original concept” in all marketing activities. “Coke Classic is the real thing!”
    
    6.The best way to respond to a new competitor is to introduce a new brand, not blurring the original one. When bottled water became popular, Coke didn’t call theirs Coke water, rather it chose Dasani.
    
    7.The first option for a follower is to establish a new category. Established brands are tough to beat, but consumers will adopt a new category more easily. Charles Schwab es
    tablished the discount brokerage category.
    
    8.The second option of a follower is to find an open position in the consumer’s mind. Starbucks became the premium quick-service coffee brand.
    
    9.The third option for a follower is to reposition the competitor to undercut the leader’s concept, product, or spokes
    person. Tylenol said, “If your stomach is upset, check with your doctor before your take aspirin.”
    
    10.Stay consistent with the positioning you choose
    
    How can my product reach the consumer? How much do the players in each distribution channel
    profit? Who holds the power in each distribution channel available?
    
    How can my product reach the consumer?
    
    A product can be differentiated from the competition by creative advertising and promotion, 
    even if competing products are physically identical.

    promotions
    
    Push or Pull Strategy? As with distribution, promotional efforts should be guided by a strategy. Pull strategies are those efforts that pull buyers to the outlets that carry your product. 
    TV pitches that instruct viewers “to ask for Perdue chicken by name at your local grocer” pull consumers to the stores that carry it. 
    Another important mission of promotion is to encourage the distribution channels to stock and sell a product to consumers. Such efforts are a push strategy.
    
    Price Based on the Price Elasticity of the Buyer. Price elasticity describes how a buyer’s behavior changes due to a change in price.
    
    
  Break even is the point at which the fixed costs are recovered from the sale of goods but no profit is made.
  Promotion and manufacturing are expensive. A way must be found to recoup those investments. That’s the whole point of marketing: to recover costs and make profits.
    
    Who is the target?
    Product—Fit with other products? Differentiation, PLC, perception, packaging, features
    Place—How best to reach segment? Channel mathematics, draw channels
    Exclusive, selective, intensive distribution? Fit with product?
    Who has the power?
    How to motivate the channels?
    Promotion —What is the buying process? How are $’s targeted to buying-process goals?
    Push or pull strategy?
    Media—type, measure, message?
    Dealer incentives?
    Consumer promos—coupons, contests?
    Price—What strategy? Skim, penetrate?
    Seek volume or profits?
    Perceived value, cost-plus pricing?
    How does price relate to the market, size, product life cycle, competition?

    title: 'The unfair advantage',
    body: `The path to success is not just self-discipline, belief and hard work.

    Success in the startup world is not simply awarded to the hardest workers.
    It is awarded to those who develop and use their Unfair Advantages.
    
    By ‘unfair advantage’ we do not mean an unethical or illegal advantage
    (although we’re sure there are many of those). An unfair advantage is a
    competitive upper hand, and your set of unfair advantages is unique to you. It’s
    more than just a unique selling point, it’s a fundamental leg-up over the
    competition, and sometimes it’s not one that is ‘earned’ or worked for.
    
    The business idea is important,
    
    can’t get enough customers and/or users.
    
    Most startups fail, not because they can’t build a product. But because they can’t get traction.
    
    It will help you no matter the challenges you may be facing, whether you
    need to find a co-founder, get your first customer, juggle a full-time job while
    getting your startup off the ground, get funding, build an MVP (minimum viable
    product ‒ which we’ll explain in Part Three), get users, develop your sales,
    marketing and growth hacking, generate enough cash to extend your ‘runway
    time’ to keep your startup afloat, handle competitors, attract mentors and
    advisors, and more.
    
    obviously hard work and sacrifice is a factor.
    Sacrifice is required for success because you do have to forgo some short-term
    pleasures for long-term success.
    
    I would never have learned how to do websites, and
    how to do online marketing. I learned all these things at just the right time.
    
    Sales is a fantastic way to get started if you want to start your own business,
    because the skills you learn, and in particular the resilience to the rejection and
    the ‘no’s that you develop, are absolutely indispensable.
    
    talent doesn’t exist, that it’s somehow all about hard work, practice and
    putting in the ‘10,000 hours’.
    
    Startup founder stress and burnout
    are incredibly common and it’s important to look after yourself, your physical
    and mental health. We have to define success for ourselves in a way that’s
    unconstrained by a narrow view of external achievement, in order to be able to
    find happiness.
    
    Our aim is not to make you look at the world and despair, or to think that if
    there are unfair elements at work then it’s not worth trying. Instead, we want to
    equip you with knowledge of the obstacles in your path, and also the possible
    shortcuts that are in front of you which you may be unaware of. It’s like a
    headwind – if you’re cycling straight into the wind, you’re going to find it a lot
    harder than if you have a strong tailwind behind you pushing you forward. If you
    know about the wind in advance, then you can plan your cycle ride in the most
    favourable direction. We want to help you pick your direction
    
    For any early-stage startup, the Unfair Advantage of that startup is the sum of the individual Unfair
    Advantages of the founders.
    
    Always partner up with somebody with unfair advantages that balance
    out yours.
    Make no mistake, every successful company starts with a personal jumpingoff
    point from the founders, be that money, intelligence, expertise, status or
    connections.
    
    An always-busy restaurant will attract more bookings.
    A film that’s a box-office success will attract more movie-goers.
    A book that’s a bestseller will attract more readers.
    A YouTube video with lots of views will get more views.
    In this context, the more unfair advantages you have, the more you are likely
    to accrue. The key is to start identifying and developing your own unfair
    advantages as soon as possible, no matter your age.
    
    powerful startup incubator in the world, says: ‘Startup = Growth. A startup is a
    company designed to grow fast.’
    In a world where market giants and big funded startups can make one
    decision and crush fifteen budding startups, speed is absolutely critical to
    survival
    
    Speed is what finding and leveraging your unfair advantages gives you – it’s
    the rocket ship you and your team need.
    
    You can work to develop unfair advantages for yourself, based on what you
    have to start with – you can get an education, develop expertise, move cities or
    even countries, make friends, expand your networks and, most importantly,
    change your mindset. These are unfair advantages that you can develop
    proactively.
    
    Money
    Intelligence and Insight
    Location and Luck
    Education and Expertise
    Status
    
    All of these advantages are built on the foundation of Mindset, which is the
    one you have the most control over and where you have the most leverage. You
    can see this illustrated in the diagram on the following page.
    
    The classification most widely accepted in psychology is that of the ‘Big 5’
    personality traits:
    Openness ‒ how open you are to new experiences, and how imaginative you are
    Conscientiousness ‒ how organised, self-disciplined and goal-oriented you are
    Extraversion ‒ how much you enjoy spending your time around other people
    Agreeableness ‒ how friendly, compassionate and cooperative you are
    Neuroticism ‒ how prone you are to worry, anxiety or stress
    
    The number one trait to consider after neuroticism is being visionary, which
    is very similar to the trait of openness. It’s important as an entrepreneur to be
    curious, to have ideas and to be unafraid to experience new thingsThe number one trait to consider after neuroticism is being visionary, which

    you’re grateful for in life can make you feel happier, less stressed and more

    Emotional intelligence is so vital because business is between people, and as
    people we are very affected by emotion, more so than logic. If you can read,
    understand and affect people’s emotions positively, you can influence and
    persuade them. That’s how you attract co-founders, mentors, investors and
    employees to join you in your startup. That’s how you negotiate a pay rise.
    That’s how you connect with customers. Emotional intelligence is key.
    
    If your business idea starts with getting users and not customers, then they’re
    the ones you need to focus onIf your business idea starts with getting users and not customers, then they’re
    the ones you need to focus on
    
    1. Cultivate your curiosity.
    2. Ask more questions.
    3. Do more experiments.
    4. Be more interested in how people feel, and the emotional impact things have
    on them.
    5. Notice when people say something is a pain to do, or is inconvenient. These
    are goldmines for valuable insights (more about this in Chapter 14 – the
    Idea).
    6. Be more aware of your own emotions and moods, and don’t let them dictate
    your actions.
    
    Do more things. Meet more people. Go to more events. Blog about your
    startup. Produce things and publish them. Get feedback. Put more stuff out into
    the world. This is a very powerful way of increasing your luck, because it’s like
    trying to roll a double six on a pair of dice, and you can roll as many times as
    you like. Obviously, you’d just keep rolling the dice until you got a double six.
    That’s increasing your chances, because nobody is counting your number of
    attempts in life.
    
    Expertise is simple. It is a self-taught process where, for the most part, you learn
    by doing.
    
    Your Status is your personal brand. It is how others see you. It is your social
    standing, your appearance, gender, age, how you dress, stand, talk. It’s also your
    perceived credibility
    
    Outer Status
    For better or worse, in most societies, a doctor is perceived as higher in status
    than a nurse, a CEO higher than an intern, and a billionaire higher than a single
    mother living on government benefits. And, if you’re driving a Bentley or Lamborghini,
    
    Have you ever noticed that in stories about startup founders, if one of them
    comes from a high-status company or university, they never fail to mention it?
    For example, you’ll often read: ‘Ex-Googler starts a new company.’ ‘Ex-
    Goldman Sachs director joins the team.’ ‘Stanford dropout founds a new
    startup.’ Do you ever wonder why?
    There are many ways of increasing your social status, and this chapter is
    about understanding the power of status, understanding the different forms and
    contexts of status, and finally how to make the most of what you’ve got.
    
    Your Inner Status is an extremely powerful way to increase your Outer Status. It
    is your self-esteem. Your confidence. Self-esteem is just a fancy way of saying
    ‘liking yourself’. And whether or not you’re confident or have high self-esteem
    always shines through to other people. They pick up on it, consciously and
    unconsciously, through your body language, voice tonality and other subtle clues
    in your behaviour. That’s how inner status increases your outer status.Your Inner Status is an extremely powerful way to increase your Outer Status. It

    in your behaviour. That’s how inner status increases your outer status.
    If you like and value yourself, you will have high self-esteem. You’ll come
    across as confident, competent, likeable, trustworthy and engaging.
    
    don’t forget the importance of inner status. Your confidence and selfesteem
    will shine through. Make sure to work on liking yourself, and building
    your conviction in yourself. Bear in mind that everyone feels unconfident or out
    of their depth sometimes. Everyone gets imposter syndrome. You have to push
    through it. Question your inner critic. Push yourself outside of your comfort
    zone regularly, so you can start having faith in yourself that you’ll manage. Get
    that feeling of resourcefulness inside you.
    
    One of the keys to finding a co-founder, or a mentor, advisor or investor, is
    networking, which really just means meeting and building relationships with
    people.
    There are two ingredients needed to develop your network:
    1. An authentic desire to add value to people you meet
    2. Increasing your Status so that people perceive more value from you`

    • Be passionate about your products and services so that passion gets transferred (the first sales person had all the passion of an old shoe box)

    promises. Tons of hyperbole. Tons of lofty statements that never amount
    to anything.

    make a decision that will revolutionize your
    career/life/self: never leave the site of an opportunity
    without doing something to seize it.
    
    And be less about talk - and more about DO.
