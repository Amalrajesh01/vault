      You can never predict what happens after you start a business. Long-term plans and detailed documents are pointless. 
      Most businesses go on to do something very different from what they set out to do. Today, this is called a pivot.
  
      “A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” Eric Ries
  
      A startup is a bit more exciting. It has:
      1. High impact potential.
      2. High levels of innovation.
      3. High levels of uncertainty
  
      I want you to think about launching a startup instead of a business. Anyone can create a job for themselves.
       But not everyone can change the world
  
      With high impact potential and high levels of innovation, a startup has the ability to change the world.
  
      Work on your business, not in your business—impossible and impractical when you are bootstrapping a new idea.
       Optimize your funnel—pointless when you have no leads. Hack your growth—difficult before you have customers.
  
      Execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world
  
      Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time
  
      Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers.
       That could mean “getting out of the building” for some. For you, your skillset, your customers, and your business, it might mean something totally different.
  
      “Move fast and break things.” Mark Zuckerberg
  
      Before you start a task, your brain visualizes the hardest parts to come. It then tries to simulate real work by focusing on small mindless tasks.
       In other words, you spend hours and days fussing over logos and website copy instead of selling your product
  
      A wantrepreneur is someone who wants to be an entrepreneur, but is so obsessed with watching TED talks and talking about their business ideas that they never launch them
  
      If you have a conversation with a friend about your business idea this month, and next month you are having the same conversation, you are a wantrepreneur
  
      “The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before.” Neil Gaiman
  
      1. The Idea Matters - A bad idea, executed well, will not make a good business.
      2. Execution Matters - A good idea, executed poorly, will not make a good business.
      3. A Founder’s Ability to Get Customers (To Hustle) Matters - A great idea, executed well, will fail without customers.
      4. Timing Matters - Speaking hypothetically about an idea is pointless if the timing is wrong.
      5. Luck Matters - In fact, it matters much more than most entrepreneurs would care to admit.
  
      It makes no sense to start a business that is going to have you doing work you don’t enjoy. If you don’t like what you see, then 
      it’s not a good business idea for you. Other than that, don’t worry about passion.
  
      Startup founders should have the ambition to grow their business into a larger company. If you don’t have that ambition, what you are creating is not a startup.
  
      Focusing on short-term launches or projects won’t build assets. Assets are built over time by ignoring short-term distractions in favor of a bigger, longterm vision.
  
      A list of customers that pay you every month is an asset. If you focus on shortterm projects you’ll make more money initially.
     But if you turn down projects and focus on providing recurring value, you build a valuable asset. Your product design and intellectual property are assets.
     If you resell or copy someone else’s product, you might have better margins in the short term; but creating your own gives you a long-term asset.
     Your team is an asset. If you hire mediocre people to save money, you get more money in the short term. If you hire great people,
      you are building a valuable asset that grows your business.
  
      Creating a startup means creating something valuable for your customers that is a long-term asset.
       It doesn’t mean going after low-hanging fruit, getting caught up in get rich quick schemes, or chasing passive income 
       fundamentally entrepreneurship is about creating a product that people want and selling it to them.
  
      “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them,” is correct. Everyone might be saying that your idea is great,
       but look at whether or not they are currently paying for a solution to the same problem.
  
      Write down exactly what you will launch on Day 7. What will your customers get, what is included, and what is excluded? 
      If necessary, write down what is automated and what will be done manually in the short term.
  
      Day 1 Task - Brainstorm a bunch of ideas and evaluate them against the checklist. Choose the idea that stands out as being the best option for you.
       You can use the template provided at wpcurve.com/7daystartup if that helps. Most importantly, keep your name to fewer than 12 characters if possible.
  
      Create in-depth content based around the customer problems that your business solves.
      2. Make content as actionable and useful to your target audience as possible.
      3. It can’t be boring. Don’t just create content around your area of expertise. Create anything that is interesting to your potential customers
  
      Getting press attention for your company can be a huge bonus. If it’s well targeted, it leads to direct customers. 
      Perhaps a bigger benefit is the extra proof and credibility you get as a result
  
      Marketing is really just about getting your message out to qualified people as efficiently as possible.
       Connect your message with them as best you can
  
      Day 5 Task - Build a list of what marketing methods you are going to choose. Put together a rough plan for the first week or two of your launch.
       To make it easier, Save your excitement until you land people you don’t know as customers.
  
      Create a spreadsheet that covers the first few months in business, the number of signups, revenue, estimated costs, and monthly growth
  
      “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Reid Hoffman
  
      Day 7 Task - Launch and start executing your marketing plan.
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      If you have an open mind, you can easily test your assumptions and those assumptions made by others in your industry.
       Why does everyone in your industry do things a certain way? What do your customers really like about your service? Why aren’t people buying your product?
        Why are they buying your product? Are people using your product? How are they using it? Why do they love it?
  
      What do they tell people when they refer you? Are certain parts of your product necessary? Do you need an office? Do you need a business card? Do you need a logo
  
      Being true to your word is a very important part of building trust in business. Whether you are offering services or selling a product,
       make sure you always deliver on what you promise. You can do everything else right, but if you are the guy or girl that promises the world and doesn’t deliver,
        your mistake will be uncovered in the end. Your reputation is everything and it will impact every business you start, not just this one.
         It’s far better to under-promise and over-deliver, or at the very least deliver exactly what you promise every time.
  
      Don’t debate every last issue internally until you are blue in the face. Whatever you are discussing can probably be solved by 
      either looking at what other companies have done before you, or implementing a quick decision and learning from the real data. 
      The minute that you are debating could be distracting you from a fundamental problem that you aren’t seeing.
       Always take a step back and ask yourself if it’s feasible that someone else may have solved this problem before
  
      “Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. 
      This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.”
  
      Eric Ries calls it “Build, Measure, Learn.” Michael Masterson calls it “Ready Fire Aim.” I call it “Getting Shit Done.”
  
      Your own personal happiness and motivation are the most important keys to the success of your business.
       I know plenty of people who have created great businesses, taken them to a point, and then lost all motivation.
        If you are struggling with motivation, join a forum, start a mastermind, find a cofounder, hire people to do the hard work, and get back to what you’re good at.
         Take the warning signs seriously. You should be more excited about Monday than you are about Friday. 
         If that’s not the case, there’s a good chance things aren’t going to work out
  
      Difficult customers will waste your time, kill your confidence, and destroy your motivation (and soul).
       No amount of money is worth working with a difficult customer. Every difficult customer can be replaced by a better one, generally much quicker than you think. 
       The work required to replace them is a far better use of your time than any work spent trying to help them
  
      Think in the long term about what asset you are building as a result of actions you complete today.
       Getting carried away on short-term projects will kill any chance of momentum and hurt growth
  
      Running a business can be daunting. Every expert has a different opinion on some “must have” technique or technology you need to be using. 
      It’s hard to know where to spend your time, money, and attention. If you are in doubt, come back to the product. 
      Anything you can do that improves the product or improves the customer experience will be a sound investment.
  
      14. Love Your Work If you don’t, the rest will fall apart. It’s that simple
  
      “The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.” Eric Ries Hopefully I’ve set you on a path to create an exciting and profitable startup.
       The first major hurdle is launching; then, getting your first customer; and then, proving the concept and generating a wage for yourself in a scalable way.
        What happens after all that? Now it’s time to run your business, and your decisions from here out will make or break it in the long term.
         Most businesses don’t survive, so what do you do to keep yours growing?

    title: '10X Rule',
    body: `These concepts of goal setting, target attainment, and taking action are not taught in
    schools,
    
    When people start limiting the amount of success they desire, I assure you they
    will limit what will be required of them in order to achieve success and will fail
    miserably at doing what it takes to keep it.
    
    This is the focus of the 10X Rule: You
    must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times
    what you think it will take to accomplish those targets. Massive thoughts must be
    followed by massive actions. There is nothing ordinary about the 10X Rule. It is
    simply what it says it is: 10 times the thoughts and 10 times the actions of other
    people.
    
    Spending too much time competing and not enough time dominating their
    sector.
    
    A person who limits his or her potential success will limit what he or she
    will do to create it and keep it.
    
    countless banks, companies, and even entire
    industries, failed to appropriately assess the situation
    
    As long as you are alive,
    you will either live to accomplish your own goals and dreams or be used as a resource
    to accomplish someone else’s
    
    Most people’s—including managers’—first response
    is to reduce the target rather than increase their activity.
    
    Never reduce a target.
    Instead, increase actions
    
    the target is never the problem. Any target attacked with
    the right actions in the right amounts with persistence is attainable.
    
    regardless
    of how detailed your business plan is. I don’t care if your product cost nothing to
    make and it’s 100 times superior to its closest competitor; you will still have to
    apply 10 times more effort just to push through all the noise in order to get people
    to even know about it
    
    If you want to save time in getting your idea or product to
    market, then you must make sure you do 10 times more of everything in order to
    be in more places with more people over shorter durations.
    
    success does not merely
    “happen.” It is the result of relentless, proper actions taken over time. Only those
    who operate with the appropriate view and corresponding actions will have success
    
    1. Success is important.
    2. Success is your duty.
    3. There is no shortage of success
    
    You know, you don’t need to grow old to die. I was dying at the age of 20 as a result
    of no direction and no purpose.
    
    luck is just one of the byproducts of those who
    take the most action. The reason why successful people seem lucky is because
    success naturally allows for more success.
    
    “The harder I work, the luckier I get
    
    To get where you want to go in life, you must adopt the view that whatever is going
    on in your world—good, bad, or nothing—is something caused by you
    
    If you are willing
    to take credit when you win,
    
    Increase your responsibility level, assume control for
    everything that happens to you, and live by the slogan that nothing happens to
    you—only because of you! And remember, “Don’t be a little bitch.”
    
    You can also
    expect to be criticized and labeled by others when you start taking massive action.
    The second you start hitting it big, you will immediately be judged by the mediocre.
    People who operate at the other three levels of action will be threatened by your
    activity level and will often make it seem somehow “wrong” in order to make
    themselves right.
    
    No one is going to come to your house and make your dreams come
    true. No one is going to march into your company and make your products known
    to the world. In order to stand out from the crowd—and for customers to even
    consider your products, services, and organization—you must take massive action.
    I
    
    entire companies and industries are being wiped out as a result of average
    products, average management, average workers, average actions, and average
    thinking.
    
    The average worker reads an average of less than one book a year and
    works an average of 37.5 hours per week. This 62 THE 10X RULE same person makes
    319 times less money than the top U.S. CEOs, who claim to read more than 60
    books a year. Many of these financially successful executives are maligned for the
    huge sums of money they receive
    
    Most businesses fail because they are unable to
    sell their ideas, products, and services at prices high enough to sustain the company
    and fund its activities.
    
    Average thinking and actions will only guarantee you misery,
    uncertainty, and failure
    
    Ask yourself whether the goals you have set are equal to your
    potential. Most people will admit that their goals are well below their potential—
    because most of the world has been convinced, persuaded, and even educated
    to set small, attainable, and realistic goals
    
    1. Set 10X targets.
    2. Align them with your other purposes.
    3. Write them down every day—when you wake up and before you go to sleep.
    
    Forward thinkers don’t copy. They don’t compete—they create. They also don’t look
    at what others have done.
    
    Never make it your goal to compete. Instead, do everything you
    can to dominate your sector in order to avoid spending your time chasing someone
    else.
    
    You can’t dominate if you don’t penetrate,
    82 THE 10X RULE and you won’t penetrate by using reasonable levels of activity. Your
    biggest problem is obscurity—other people don’t know you and aren’t thinking
    about you.
    
    Two things will happen when you take the right amount of action: (1) You will
    get a new set of problems and (2) your competition will start promoting you
    
    vLearn
    how to dominate by being first in the minds of your market, your clients, and even
    your competitors. Market conditions won’t improve until you improve the way you
    think and approach the market.
    
    To dominate your sector, your goal, dream, or ambition, you must
    fi rst dominate your every interest, thought, and consideration.
    
    Make your dreams, goals, and mission your mind’s and actions’ dominant concern
    
    I suggest that you become obsessed about the things you want; otherwise, you are
    going to spend a lifetime being obsessed with making up excuses as to why you
    didn’t get the life you wanted.
    
    The most valuable chips you have are your mind-set, actions, persistence, and creativity.
    You can go “all in” with energy as many times as you want—because even if
    you fail, you can keep going all in!
    
    There is no failure unless you
    quit! It is impossible for you to “use up” all of your energy— or creativity. It is impossible
    for you to run out of ideas. You’ll never lose the ability to come up with new
    dreams, have more energy, think creatively, look at a situation or event differently,
    Go “All In” and Overcommit
    
    You may lose the customer, but
    so what? You still have unlimited resources to give it your all
    with the next client. You have everything to gain and nothing
    to lose; you simply have to rethink your approach
    
    Grand claims, overcommitment, and extreme promises will immediately separate
    you from the masses—and therefore force you to deliver at 10X levels.
    
    Most
    companies fail not because they stay on the offensive but because they don’t
    properly prepare themselves for expansion and cannot dominate the sector
    
    you must
    keep adding wood until the fi re is burning so hot that no one—and nothing—can
    put out your successes.
    
    All the excuses in the world won’t change one simple fact: that fear is a sign to
    do whatever it is you fear—and do it quickly.
    
    Eat your fears; don’t feed them by
    backing off or giving them time to grow.
    
    The busier you become, the more you
    have to manage, control, and prioritize
    
    Customer service is the wrong target; increasing
    customers is the right target. This doesn’t mean customer satisfaction isn’t
    important. Everyone knows that customers have to be satisfi ed and happy in order
    for them to return and give positive word of mouth.
    
    Make your primary focus commanding attention and generating customers before
    you worry about making them happy
    
    You can’t keep everyone happy all the
    time. It’s a mistake to be scared of complaints. Instead, encourage them, look for
    them, fi nd them, and then resolve them. Complaints are your customers’ very direct
    way of telling you exactly how to make your product better. If
    
    There are, of course,
    measures 140 THE 10X RULE you can take to improve your product or service.
    But when dealing with human beings, you are going to face complaints and
    dissatisfaction.
    
    Is Starbucks concerned about people standing in line too long and
    getting the right coffee and being greeted?
    
    If you truly want to fi nd out what your
    organization’s customer acquisition and loyalty weaknesses are, then survey the
    people who you do not acquire. The sooner you can ask them questions, the better—ideally, as they leave or refuse the business. And be sure to ask them about the
    processes—not about the people—they encountered. You might ask questions
    like the following:
    How long were you here?
    Did you meet a manager?
    Were you shown optional products?
    Were you presented with a proposal?
    Did anyone offer to bring the product to your home/
    offi ce?
    
    You want people to see you so often that they think of you constantly
    and instantaneously identify your face or name or logo with not just the offering
    you represent but even the offering made by those similar to you.
    
    Rather than
    spending energy on retaliating, I spent all my energy, resources, and creativity on
    becoming omnipresent and expanding my footprint
    
    An “excuse” is a justifi cation for
    doing—or not doing—something.
    
    All powerful companies, ideas, products, and
    people are omnipresent. They can be found everywhere. They dominate their
    sector and become synonymous with that which they represent.
    
    The quality of
    being rare is what makes something valuable. So anything that is plentiful has very
    little worth.
    
    The following list of ways you should act in order to be successful
    
    1. Have a “Can Do” Attitude
    People with a “can do” attitude approach every situation with
    the outlook that no matter what, it can be done. They consistently
    use phrases like “We can do it,” “Let’s make it happen,” “Let’s work it out”—
    and they always maintain that a solution exists
    
    2. Believe That “I Will Figure It Out” 
    it refers to the individual who is always looking to be
    responsible and solve a problem. Even if you’re not sure how
    to do something, the best answer is “I will fi gure it out”—
    
    17. Embrace Change
    
    18. Determine and Take the Right Approach
    
    The right approach may be to institute a public
    relations program that softens the market, provide consumers
    with the right tool, or compel management to make the most
    powerful connections, fi nd the best fi rst investors, or hire
    the highest-quality staff.
    
    9. Break Traditional Ideas
    
    20. Be Goal-Oriented
    
    If you don’t stay
    focused on your goals, you will spend your life achieving the objectives
    of other people—particularly those who are goal-oriented
    
    21. Be on a Mission
    
    Successful employees, employers, entrepreneurs, and market
    Successful or Unsuccessful? 177
    changers consider their daily activities to be part of a more
    important mission that will change things signifi cantly. They
    are always thinking bigger and homing in on some massive
    target to achieve.
    
    22. Have a High Level of Motivation
    
    You can encourage, you
    can challenge, and you can inspire, but true motivation—the
    underlying reason for doing something
    
    23. Be Interested in Results
    
    24. Have Big Goals and Dreams
    
    25. Create Your Own Reality
    
    26. Commit First—Figure Out Later
    
    27. Be Highly Ethical
    
    28. Be Interested in the Group
    
    29. Be Dedicated to Continuous Learning
    
    30. Be Uncomfortable
    
    It feels good when things are familiar.
    However, successful people are willing to put themselves
    in new and unfamiliar situations. That
    
    31. “Reach Up” in Relationships
    
    Yet the average person typically spends his or her
    time with like-minded people
    
    Black belts don’t
    learn new skills from white belts
    
    32. Be Disciplined
    
    None of the things on this list is a superhuman quality.
    Every single one is attainable
    
    You certainly can’t start
    yesterday, and if you wait until tomorrow, you won’t be a success
    because you will have violated an important tenet of the
    successful: Act now and then keep acting with the knowledge
    that enough actions taken now will create the future
    
    1. Do not reduce your goals as you write them.
    2. Do not get lost in the details of how to accomplish them
    at this point.
    3. Ask yourself, “What actions can I take today to move me
    toward these goals?”
    4. Take whatever actions you come up with—regardless of
    what they are or how you feel.
    5. Do not prematurely value the outcome of your actions.
    6. Go back each day and review the list.
    
    Look around you and you will see
    the world filled with average people, average thinking, and—at best—average
    actions.

    What hurts us is not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us. The most important thing is how we RESPOND to what happens to us in our lives. 
    And that is a CHOICE!
    
    Write down at least three changes that you want to make today:
    
    "The universe is change; our life is what our thoughts make it." - Marcus Aurelius
    
    "You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you." - James Allen
    
    Positive thinking is to see reality as it is, accept it, and make the best of it.
    
    Your thoughts depend on your beliefs about life.
    
    "These then are my last words to you. Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living, and your belief will help create the fact.
    
    If you think that you won't make it, if you think that it's impossible, then you will not achieve it even if your effort is huge.
    
    I create my destiny.
    Nobody can hurt me if I don't allow it.
    Life is great!
    Everything happens for a reason.
    Everything is going to be all right.
    I can do it!
    
    "The optimist sees the donut, the pessimist sees the hole."
    
    "A pessimist is somebody who complains about the noise when opportunity knocks."
    
    "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time."
    
    "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."
    
    "Be willing to be uncomfortable. Be comfortable being uncomfortable. It may get tough, but it's a small price to pay for living a dream." - Peter McWilliams
    
    Have a clear goal and the burning desire to achieve it.
    Make a clear plan and act on it with daily action steps.
    Be immune to all negative and discouraging influences.
    Have a support system of one or more people who will encourage you.
    "How can it be done?" If you ask yourself "how," your brain will search for an answer and come up with it. The good thing is that
     you can really change your life by changing your language, talking to yourself in a positive way, and starting to ask yourself different questions.
    
    Spend the first 15 minutes of your working day prioritizing what to do.
    Spend one hour a week for organizing and filing papers.
    Spend 15 minutes a day throwing away papers and clearing away your desk.
    Spend the last 15 minutes of your working day going through your tasks for tomorrow. What's important? What's urgent?
    
    "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody." - Bill Cosby
    
    "It is well to be up before daybreak, for such habits contribute to health, wealth, and wisdom."
    
    It's scientifically proven that 6 hours should be enough sleep per night paired with a 30 to 60-minute power nap in the afternoon. 
    Your freshness depends on the quality of your sleep, not on the quantity.
    
    You have to try and figure out for yourself how many hours of sleep you need to feel refreshed. But you should definitely give it a try.
     It will improve your quality of life a lot. Don't forget that getting up early is a new habit, so give it some time and don't give up after 
     the first week if you still feel tired after getting up earlier. The habit needs at least 3 to 4 weeks to kick in.
    
    In the end, getting up or hitting the snooze button is a decision you make. It's up to you. How important is a better lifestyle and more time for you?
    
    "It's choice – not chance – that determines your destiny."
    
    "The fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself." - Paolo Coelho
    
    "You gain strength, courage, and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You must do the thing which you think you cannot do." - Eleanor Roosevelt
    
    "Great things are done by a series of small things brought together." - Vincent van Gogh
    
    "It isn't the mountains ahead that wear you out. It's the grain of sand in your shoe." - Robert Service
    
    "Bottom line is, if you do not use it or need it, it's clutter, and it needs to go." - Charisse Ward
    
    "Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year."
    
    Think positive: Today is going to be a great day!
    Remember for 5 minutes what you are grateful for.
    15 minutes of quiet time.
    Imagine the day that is about to start going very well.
    Watch a sunrise.
    Go running or take a walk.
    Write in your journal.
    
    The last half an hour of your day has the same importance! The things you do in the last half an hour before sleeping will remain in your subconscious during your sleep. 
    So then it's time to do the following:
    Write into your journal again.
    Now is the time for reflecting on your day. What did you do great? What could you have done even better?
    
    "The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why."
    
    What do I really want to do with my life?
    When do I feel fully alive?
    What were the highlights of my life?
    What am I doing when time flies by? What inspires me?
    What are my greatest strengths?
    What would I do if success was guaranteed?
    What would I do if I had ten million Dollars, seven houses, and had traveled all around the world?
    
    Communicate clearly and make it a habit to address anything that bothers you on the spot. Remember what the proverb says: "In the right tone you can say everything,
     in the wrong tone nothing, the art is to find the right tone." Practice saying things in a neutral tone of voice like you'd say "the sun is shining."
    
    "Be thankful for what you have; you'll end up having more. If you concentrate on what you don't have, you will never, ever have enough." - Oprah Winfrey
    
    "Our expectancies not only affect how we see reality but also affect the reality itself."
    
    The benefits of shifting your thinking will be:
    Less stress, fear, and anxiety.
    You will feel more peaceful.
    Your energy level will go up.
    It allows you to be the inventor of your own experience.
    
    "I use memories, but I will not allow memories to use me."
    
    Celebrate that you are better than you were last week! Don't let your small victories go unnoticed.
    
    If you learned new habits and see great improvement, go on a short trip! You earned it.
    
    DO one thing at a time! The newest studies show that multitasking is actually less productive than doing one thing at a time with a concentrated effort. 
    Some studies even imply that it makes you slower and – careful now – dumber.
    
    Forget about multitasking. Focus on doing one thing at a time and do it with concentration!
    
    A huge step towards simplifying your life is to concentrate on the important, on the activities that make sense for you, and find a way to eliminate or downsize the others.
    
    "When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen."
    
    "Be the change you want to see in the world."
    
    "Try not. Do or do not. There is no try."
    
    Just trying doesn't take you anywhere. I'm in line with Master Yoda: Do or do not!
    
    Charged and in the present tense. Here are some examples:
    Money comes to me easily and effortlessly.
    Opportunities come into my life right now.
    Speaking in front of a large audience is easy for me.
    I am successful in my business.
    I am healthy and fit.
    
    Use affirmations to attract the things you want in your life. The more you practice, the better you get. The first time you say...
    
    "It's the repetition of affirmations that lead to belief. And once that belief becomes a deep conviction, things begin to happen." - Muhammad Ali
    
    "The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it." - Jordan Belfort
    
    "Always deliver more than expected."
    
    Design your ideal day.
    
    "I'll see it when I believe it!" - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer
    
    Perceive and express emotions (Permit yourself to feel it).
    Facilitation of feelings (How can I feel a different emotion).
    Understanding (Why is this emotion coming up).
    Emotional adjustment (Now I know why the emotion was felt…).
    Advantages of managing emotions:
    You recover better and faster from problems and setbacks.
    You achieve better and consistent professional performance.
    You are able to prevent those tensions from building up that destroy your relationships.
    You govern your impulses and conflicting emotions.
    You stay balanced and serene even in critical moments.

    "Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone." - Pablo Picasso
    
    62: Ask for what you really want
    
    Remember to keep your thoughts, feelings, and inner dialogue positive.
    
    Ask the person who is in charge.
    
    Be specific.
    
    Ask repeatedly like you did when you were a kid.
    
    Make a list of all your complaints.
    
    What have your complaints achieved?
    
    Transform your complaints into requests.
    
    Stop spending time with the wrong people!
    
    "Whatever you do you need courage. Whatever course you decide upon, there will always be someone to tell you that you are wrong." - Ralph Waldo Emerson
    
    "The person who says it can't be done shouldn't interrupt the person who is doing it."
    
    Stay away from the naysayers, the blamers, the complainers.
    
    "Don't let the noise of the opinions of others drown your own inner voice."
    
    "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
     Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 
     They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."
    
    Live the life you want and not the life other people expect of you.
    
    Accept yourself as you are. You don't have to be perfect to be great! Learn to spend time with the most important person in your life – YOU.
    
    Commit yourself to becoming the best person you can be. Invest around 5-10% of your income in training, books, CDs, and other ways of personal development.
    
    Stay curious and eager to learn new things and better yourself. A nice side effect of investing in your personal growth is that while you become a wiser person...
    
    There are so many possibilities: you could learn training that improves your negotiating skills, time management, financial planning, and much more.
    
    "We have to dare to be ourselves, however frightening or strange that self may prove to be."
    
    "To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."
    
    "To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear."
    
    "Those who do not find time for exercise will have to find time for illness."
    
    "Whatever you do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius and power and magic in it." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
    
    "I am only one, but I am one. I cannot do everything, but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do."
    
    Take action. Make things happen.
    
    "Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step."
    
    Solve your problems. Face them. Because if you are running away from them they will come after you.
    
    "If a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. 
    There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever."
    
    "Men have become the tools of their tools."
    
    "As you move outside of your comfort zone, what was once the unknown and frightening becomes your new normal." - Robin Sharma
    
    The price you pay for procrastination is anxiety and feeling bad. Choose your suffering wisely.
    
    There is no guarantee that coaching works. Your success depends on you.
    
    "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."
    
    "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop." - Confucius
    
    Make a timeline of your life. From birth until now. Mark every key event in your life on the line. All and any moments that changed your life.
    Write the great moments, the successes above the timeline.
    Write the challenges, the tragedies, the failures below the timeline.
    Examine the events below the line and write the positive effects of them above the line.
    (For example, somebody close to you died. A positive could be that you value your life more. Or perhaps you got fired from a job.
       This opened doors to an even better job that you have now.)
    There is no guarantee that coaching works. Your success depends on you.
    
    "Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment."
    
    "I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.
    I wish I didn't work so hard.
    I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.
    I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
    I wish that I had let myself be happier."

    title: '80 20 principle',
    body: `The 80/20 Principle states that there is an inbuilt imbalance between causes and results, inputs and outputs, and effort and reward.

    In 1963, IBM discovered that about 80 percent of a computer’s time is spent executing about 20 percent of the operating code. 
    The company immediately rewrote its operating software to make the most-used 20 percent very accessible and user-friendly, 
    thus making IBM computers more efficient and faster than competitors’ machines for the majority of applications.
    
    We may feel that some of our time is more valuable than the rest, but if we measure inputs and outputs, the disparity can still stun us.
    Does 20 percent of causes lead to 80 percent of results? Is 80 percent of any phenomenon associated with only 20 percent of a related phenomenon?
    
    Any force—whether it is a new product, a disease, a new rock group, or a new social habit such as jogging or roller-blading—finds it difficult to make headway.
    A great deal of effort generates little by way of results. At this point, many pioneers give up. But if the new force persists and can cross a certain invisible line,
    a small amount of additional effort can reap huge returns. This invisible line is the tipping point.
    
    Eighty percent of the results come from 20 percent of the causes.
    
    George Bernard Shaw put it well: “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.”
    
    There are two routes to achieving this. One is to reallocate the resources from unproductive to productive uses, the secret of all entrepreneurs down the ages. 
    A firm that finds that 80 percent of its profits come from 20 percent of its customers should use this information to concentrate on keeping that 20 percent happy 
    and increasing the business carried out with them. This is much easier, as well as more rewarding, than paying equal attention to the whole customer group.
    
    Celebrate exceptional productivity, rather than raise average efforts.
    - Look for the shortcut, rather than run the full course.
    - Exercise control over our lives with the least possible effort.
    - Be selective, not exhaustive.
    - Strive for excellence in a few things, rather than good performance in many.
    - Choose our careers and employers with extraordinary care, and if possible employ others rather than being employed ourselves.
    - Only do the thing we are best at doing and enjoy most.
    - In every important sphere, work out where 20 percent of effort can lead to 80 percent of returns.
    - Calm down, work less and target a limited number of very valuable goals where the 80/20 Principle will work for us, rather than pursuing every available opportunity.
    - Make the most of those few “lucky streaks” in our life where we are at our creative peak and the stars line up to guarantee success.
    
    The 80/20 Principle holds that a small percentage of the quality characteristics always contributes a high percentage of the quality loss.
    
    In any market, some suppliers will be much better than others at satisfying customer needs. These suppliers will obtain the highest price realizations and also the 
    highest market shares.
    
    Identify which parts of the business are making very high returns, which are just about washing their faces, and which are disasters. To do this,
    we will conduct an 80/20 Analysis of profits by different categories of business.
    
    The best way to start making money is to stop losing money.
    
    We need to go back to basics and revise the common view of the roots of business success. Waste thrives on complexity; effectiveness requires simplicity.
    
    Do not tackle everything with equal effort. Cost reduction is an expensive business! A simple business will always be better than a complex business. 
    The way to create something great is to create something simple.
    
    All entrepreneurs must believe in themselves and be confident. Entrepreneurs won't succeed at the first attempt; self-belief comes to you when you succeed. 
    While you succeed, always have empathy toward everything; how you make them feel is what you want to feel.
    
    Products from the low-cost factory progressively made goods in higher and higher categories available. Customer satisfaction, customer-centeredness, customer delight, 
    and customer obsession have become the stated goals of most enlightened and successful corporations.
    
    Four steps to lock in your core customers:
    1. Firms selling to tens of thousands or millions of consumers need to know who their key customers are.
    2. You need to provide quite exceptional or even “outrageous” service to them.
    3. Target new products and services at the core 20 percent of customers, developing them solely for and with this group.
    4. Aim to keep your core customers forever.
    
    Get everyone to adopt the methods that have the highest ratio of output to input.
    
    Although good stock management is vital, there are only four key points to it. The most strategic point is to cut down radically on your unprofitable product.
    
    80 percent of achievement and happiness takes place in 20 percent of our time—and these peaks can be expanded greatly.
    
    There are always winners and losers—and always more of the latter. You can be a winner by choosing the right competition, the right team, and the right methods to win. 
    You are more likely to win by rigging the odds in your favor (legitimately and fairly) than by striving to improve your performance. 
    You are more likely to win again where you have won before. You are more likely to win when you are selective about the races you enter.
    
    Most people spend most of their time on activities that are of low value to themselves and others.
    
    Whenever I am tempted to do too much, I remember Ronald Reagan and Warren Buffett. You should think of your own examples, of people you know personally or those in 
    the public eye, who exemplify productive inertia. Think about them often.
    
    Those who achieve the most have to enjoy what they do. It is only by fulfilling oneself that anything of extraordinary value can be created.
    
    Free yourself from obligations imposed by others. Identify, multiply the 20 percent of your time that gives you 80 percent of results, and eliminate or reduce 
    the low-value activities.
    
    The Top 10 low-value uses of time:
    1. Things other people want you to do
    2. Things that have always been done this way
    3. Things you’re not unusually good at doing
    4. Things you don’t enjoy doing
    5. Things that are always interrupted
    6. Things few other people are interested in
    7. Things that have already taken twice as long as you originally expected
    8. Things where your collaborators are unreliable or low quality
    9. Things that have a predictable cycle
    10. Answering the telephone
    
    The Top 10 highest-value uses of time:
    1. Things that advance your overall purpose in life
    2. Things you have always wanted to do
    3. Things already in the 20/80 relationship of time to results
    4. Innovative ways of doing things that promise to slash the time required and/or multiply the quality of results
    5. Things other people tell you can’t be done
    6. Things other people have done successfully in a different arena
    7. Things that use your own creativity
    8. Things that you can get other people to do for you with relatively little effort on your part
    9. Anything with high-quality collaborators who have already transcended the 80/20 rule of time, who use time eccentrically and effectively
    10. Things for which it is now or never
    
    When thinking about any potential use of time, ask two questions:
    • Is it unconventional?
    • Does it promise to
    
     multiply effectiveness?
    It is unlikely to be a good use of time unless the answer to both questions is yes.
    
    Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.
    
    If you are good at something, you can create something that will satisfy others. If you satisfy others, they will generally pay you well for it.
    
    “Success lies on the far side of failure.”
    
    The anthropologists say that if you have too much experience, too early, you exhaust your capacity for further deep relationships.
    
    The project was a total failure. The explanation was that the women were incapable of forming any deep new relationships. They were all used up. 
    Their relationship slots had been filled, forever.
    
    The best relationships are built on five attributes: mutual enjoyment of each other’s company, respect, shared experience, reciprocity, and trust.
    
    Don’t forget that all true and valuable relationships are bilateral.
    
    10 golden rules for career success:
    1. Specialize in a very small niche; develop a core skill.
    2. Choose a niche that you enjoy, where you can excel and stand a chance of becoming an acknowledged leader.
    3. Realize that knowledge is power.
    4. Identify your market and your core customers and serve them best.
    5. Identify where 20 percent of effort gives 80 percent of returns.
    6. Learn from the best.
    7. Become self-employed early in your career.
    8. Employ as many net value creators as possible.
    9. Use outside contractors for everything but your core skill.
    10. Exploit capital leverage.
    
    Leaders think and feel differently. Leaders are usually outsiders; they think and feel differently.
    
    Karl Marx’s theory of surplus value states that the workers produce all value and excess value is appropriated by the capitalists who employ the workers.
    
    Capital leverage is using money to capture additional surplus value. At its most basic, 
    it means buying machines to replace labor whenever the machines are more cost-effective.
    
    A key to successful personal investing is to match your personality and skills to one of a number of proven techniques.
    
    Koch’s 10 commandments of investment:
    1. Make your investment philosophy reflect your personality.
    2. Be proactive and unbalanced.
    3. Invest mainly in the stock market.
    4. Invest for the long term.
    5. Invest most when the market is low.
    6. If you can’t beat the market, track it.
    7. Build your investments on your expertise.
    8. Consider the merits of emerging markets.
    9. Cull your loss-makers.
    10. Run your gains.
    
    Aristotle said that the goal of all human activity should be happiness. Down the ages, we haven’t listened much to Aristotle.
    
    Two ways to be happier:
    • Identify the times when you are happiest and expand them as much as possible.
    • Identify the times when you are least happy and reduce them as much as possible.
    
    By cultivating habits of optimism, you can help to prevent disease as well as have a happier life. 
    The best way to start being happy is to stop being unhappy; avoid situations and people that tend to make us depressed or miserable.`

    **Statement by a Vietnamese monk, Thich Nhat Hanh:** "The path is the goal."
    
    **Preface**
    
    What is your Life's goal?
    
    **Preface xvi**
    
    The answer is found in the simple, yet profound, statement by a Vietnamese monk, Thich Nhat Hanh: "The path is the goal." In other words,
     finding your path in life is your goal in life. Your path is not your profession, how much money you make, your title, or your successes and failures.
    
    Me. Traditional education was crushing my spirit, trying to motivate me with the emotion of fear: the fear of making mistakes, the fear of failing,
     and the fear of not getting a job.
    
    I had no desire to study for grades, degrees, promotions, or credentials again. From then on, if I did attend a course or school,
     I went to learn, to become a better person. I was no longer in the paper chase of grades, degrees, and credentials.
    
    **Does school prepare you for the real world?**
    
    The more I studied, the more I understood why I did not like school.
    
    So many "A" students get stuck in "analysis paralysis," studying every little detail but failing to do anything. This "analysis paralysis" is caused by our educational system 
    punishing students for making mistakes.
    
    The reason so many people fail to achieve success is that they fail to fail enough times.
    
    Life was more important than money, but that money was important for supporting life.
    
    Money is important, but I don’t want to spend life working for it.
    
    One of the quotes credited to Ford goes: "Thinking is the hardest work there is. That is why so few people engage in it."
    
    "Leadership," rich dad said, "is the ability to bring out the best in people." So he trained his son and me in the technical skills necessary for becoming successful 
    in business—technical skills such as reading financial statements, marketing, sales, accounting, management, production, and negotiation.
    
    In this lesson, he stressed that we needed to learn to work with and lead people. Rich dad always said, "The technical skills of business are easy. 
    The hard part is working with people." As a reminder, I still read Stone Soup today because I personally have a tendency to be a tyrant, instead of a leader, 
    when things don’t go my way.
    
    But only a few who attempt this actually make it. Why? Because the technical skills and human skills to be successful in each quadrant are different.
    You must learn the skills and mindset required by a quadrant in order to find true success there.
    
    **B business owners** can go on vacation forever because they own a system, not a job. If the B is on vacation, 
    the money still comes in. To be successful as a B requires:
    1. Ownership or control of systems, and
    2. The ability to lead people.
    
    Most of us have heard that the secrets to great riches and wealth are:
    • OPT — Other People’s Time
    • OPM — Other People’s Money
    OPT and OPM are found in the B and I quadrants.
    
    In designing a B type of business, success simply means increasing the system and hiring more people. In other words, you work less, earn more and enjoy more free time.
    
    Regardless of how much money people make, ultimately they should put some in the I quadrant. 
    The I quadrant is where your money makes more money. It’s based on the idea that your money works hard so you don’t have to work.
    
    **Other Forms of Investing:** People invest in their education. Traditional education is important. 
    The more education you have, the better your chances may be to earn more money.
    
    We aren’t properly prepared to handle the differences between the Industrial Age and the Information Age.
    
    The idea of "study hard and find a safe, secure job" is an idea born in the Industrial Age.
    
    It takes neither money to be financially free, nor a good formal education. It also doesn’t have to be risky. 
    Instead, freedom’s price is measured in dreams, desire, and the ability to overcome disappointments that occur along the way.
    
    I think the reason most fail in the first five years is due to lack of experience and lack of capital. 
    The reason the one survivor often fails in the second five years isn’t due to lack of capital, but lack of energy. 
    The hours of long, hard work finally get to the person. Many S’s just burn out.
    
    My highly educated dad was fixated on job security, as are most people of his generation. He assumed that job security meant financial security.
    
    Just as we study at school to learn a job, I suggest you study to become a professional investor.
    
    Even if you don’t have much money, it’s important to invest in your education because, when the changes come, you’ll be better prepared to handle them.
    
    Your goal is to own a system and have people work that system for you.
    
    If operated properly, each system will provide a steady stream of income without much physical effort on the part of the owner once it’s up and running. 
    The problem is getting it up and running.
    
    There are three ways you can make it to the B side quickly.
    1. Find a mentor.
    My rich dad was my mentor. A mentor is someone who has already done what you want to do and is successful at doing it.
    
    A true B is more than a system. It’s also dependent on good people to operate the system.
    
    To be successful, you need to learn to overcome your fear of being rejected and to stop worrying about what other people say and think about you.
    
    2. To be successful, you must also learn to lead people. Working with different kinds of people is the hardest thing about business.
    The people I’ve met who are successful in any business are those who are natural leaders. The ability to get along with and inspire people is a priceless skill,
    a skill that can be learned.
    
    Have a strong mentor program. You want to learn from leaders, not advisors. You want to learn from people who are already leaders, who are on the right side, 
    and who want you to succeed.
    
    Five things happen to people who do not invest, or who invest poorly:
    1. They work hard all their lives.
    2. They worry about money all their lives.
    3. They depend on others, such as family, a company pension, or the government, to take care of them.
    4. The boundaries of their lives are defined by money.
    5. They will not know what true freedom is.
    
    Learning to invest is more important than learning a profession.
    
    My point is that it is never the investment or asset class that is important. Success or failure, wealth or poverty, depends solely on how smart the investor is. 
    A smart investor will make millions in the stock market. An amateur will lose millions.
    
    The bond market is the biggest market in the world, bigger than the stock market or the real estate market.
    
    Once a person is successful in the B quadrant, life is easy. The challenge is becoming successful.
    
    If you are here as a professional investor, congratulations. Very few people invest the time to learn and manage their own money. 
    The key to success at Level 4 is lifelong learning, great teachers, great coaches, and like-minded friends.
    
    Level-4 investors take control of their lives, knowing that their mistakes are their opportunities to learn and to grow.
    
    The fear of investing does not frighten them. It challenges them.
    
    
    
    In my world, ROI stands for a Return On Information. This means that the more information I have, the higher my returns—and the lower my risk.
    
    Remember that anything important can’t really be learned in the classroom. It must be learned by taking action, making mistakes, and then correcting them. That’s 
    when wisdom sets in.
    
    If money isn’t first in your head, it won’t stick to your hands. If it doesn’t stick to your hands, then money, and people with money, will stay away from you.
    
    Most people go to school and learn to be players in the game, but no one explains the rules to them.
    
    The real issue is the changes you must go through and who you become in the process.
    
    "Be careful of money’s addictive power," he often said. "Once you get used to receiving it, that addiction keeps you attached to the way you got it."
    
    An E works for the system. An S is the system. A B creates, owns, and controls the system. An I invests money into the system.
    
    Winston Churchill once said: "Personally, I am always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught."
    
    **Take Baby Steps:** You’ve got to walk before you can run.
    
    True learning requires mental, emotional, and physical learning. That is why action always beats inaction.
    
    People who write down their goals are more likely to achieve them.
    
    For people who want to be successful in the Information Age, the faster they develop their financial and emotional intelligence, the faster they will feel more financially
     secure and find financial freedom.
    
    The key to making any investment is setting a big goal and approaching it systematically, taking baby steps first and then gradually increasing the size of your investments
     as your learning and experience increase.
    
    In the Information Age, the people who work the hardest physically will be paid the least. It is already true today and has been true throughout history.
    
    **It's Time to Mind Your Own Business:** We are programmed to mind everyone else’s business, and ignore our own.
    
    1. Employees, making their bosses and owners rich.
    2. Debtors, making banks and money lenders rich.
    3. Taxpayers, making the government rich.
    4. Consumers, making many other businesses rich.
    
    People who cannot control their cash flow work for those who can.
    
    That is why he loved rental properties. He encouraged me to buy rental real estate because "the bank gives you the loan, but your tenant pays for it."
    
    Choose your mentors wisely. Be careful from whom you take advice. If you want to go somewhere, it is best to find someone who has already taken the journey.
     For example, if you decide to climb Mount Everest next year, obviously you would seek advice from someone who had climbed the mountain before. 
     However, when it comes to climbing financial mountains, most people get advice from people who are stuck in financial swamps.
    
    Seek mentors. Find individuals in both the investment and business arenas who might act as mentors to you.
    A. Seek out role models. Learn from them.
    B. Seek out reverse role models. Learn from them.
    
    I wanted to change my future. To do that, I had to change my thoughts, and the people I spent time with.
    
    Inside every disappointment lies a priceless gem of wisdom.
    
    I offer you the same words of advice and encouragement that rich dad offered me when I was learning something new: Be prepared to be disappointed.
    
    I have found that people who are hard on themselves mentally and emotionally are often too cautious when it comes to taking risks, adopting new ideas, 
    or attempting something new. It is hard to learn anything new if you punish yourself for your personal disappointments.
    
    Financially, there have been many times I could have run from my mistakes, but running away is taking the easy way out.
    
    "The size of your success is measured by the strength of your desire, the size of your dream, and how you handle disappointment along the way."
    
    "The times they are a-changin’." The people who are most in control of their emotions, who do not let their emotions hold them back,
     and who have the emotional maturity to learn new financial skills will flourish in the years ahead.
    
    The only person who determines the thoughts you choose to believe about yourself is you.
    
    Mirrors also reflect back our thoughts and our opinions of ourselves.
    
    These thoughts or opinions are much more important than our outward appearance.
    
    You will always hold yourself back.
    
    Begin building pipelines of cash flow to support you and your family.`

    title: 'Deep Work',
    body: `**Deep Work:** 
    Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push
    your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.
    
    Microsoft CEO Bill Gates famously conducted “Think Weeks” twice a year, during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think
    big thoughts.
    
    **Shallow Work:** 
    Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.
    
    To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. This task requires deep work.
     If you don’t cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.
    
    The second reason that deep work is valuable is because the impacts of the digital network revolution cut both ways. If you can create something useful,
     its reachable audience (e.g., employers or customers) is essentially limitless—which greatly magnifies your reward. On the other hand, 
     if what you’re producing is mediocre, then you’re in trouble, as it’s too easy for your audience to find a better alternative online.
    
    **The Deep Work Hypothesis:** 
    The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence,
     the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.
    
    For many workers, this lag predicts bad news. As intelligent machines improve, and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks, 
    employers are becoming increasingly likely to hire “new machines” instead of “new people.” And when only a human will do, improvements in communications and collaboration 
    technology are making remote work easier than ever before, motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars—leaving the local talent pool underemployed.
    
    **Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy:**
    1. The ability to quickly master hard things.
    2. The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed.
    
    That you be able to quickly master the latest research on relevant procedures. If you can’t learn, you can’t thrive.
    
    If you want to become a superstar, mastering the relevant skills is necessary, but not sufficient. 
    You must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.
    
    If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive—no matter how skilled or talented you are.
    
    To advance your understanding of your field you must tackle the relevant topics systematically.
    
    This brings us to the question of what deliberate practice actually requires. Its core components are usually identified as follows:
    1. Your attention is focused tightly on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master.
    2. You receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive.
    
    The first component is of particular importance to our discussion, as it emphasizes that deliberate practice cannot exist alongside distraction, 
    and that it instead requires uninterrupted concentration. As Ericsson emphasizes, “Diffused attention is almost antithetical to the focused attention required by deliberate practice” (emphasis mine).
    
    Myelin—a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner. 
    To understand the role of myelin in improvement, keep in mind that skills, be they intellectual or physical, eventually reduce down to brain circuits. 
    This new science of performance argues that you get better at a skill as you develop more myelin around the relevant neurons, 
    allowing the corresponding circuit to fire more effortlessly and effectively. To be great at something is to be well myelinated.
    
    By focusing intensely on a specific skill, you’re forcing the specific relevant circuit to fire, again and again, in isolation. 
    This repetitive use of a specific circuit triggers cells called oligodendrocytes to begin wrapping layers of myelin around the neurons in the circuits—effectively 
    cementing the skill. The reason, therefore, why it’s important to focus intensely on the task at hand while avoiding distraction is because this is the only way 
    to isolate the relevant neural circuit enough to trigger useful myelination. By contrast, if you’re trying to learn a complex new skill (say, SQL database management) 
    in a state of low concentration (perhaps you also have your Facebook feed open), you’re firing too many circuits simultaneously and haphazardly to isolate the group 
    of neurons you actually want to strengthen.
    
    To learn hard things quickly, you must focus intensely without distraction. To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work.
    
    **High-Quality Work Equation:**
    High-Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) x (Intensity of Focus)
    
    The problem this research identifies with this work strategy is that when you switch from some Task A to another Task B, 
    your attention doesn’t immediately follow—a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task. 
    This residue gets especially thick if your work on Task A was unbounded and of low intensity before you switched, but even if you finish Task A before moving on, 
    your attention remains divided for a while.
    
    By working on a single hard task for a long time without switching, Grant minimizes the negative impact of attention residue from his other obligations, 
    allowing him to maximize performance on this one task.
    
    Stopwatch monitoring the efficiency of worker movements—looking for ways to increase the speed at which they accomplished their tasks.
    
    “Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on.”
    
    “Concentration so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems.”
    
    The habit of frequently checking inboxes ensures that these issues remain at the forefront of their attention.
    
    Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback rules, and challenges, 
    all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, 
    is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
    
    “Deep work chambers” (he adopted the term “deep work” from my articles on the topic). Each chamber is conceived to be six by ten feet and protected by thick 
    soundproof walls (Dewane’s plans call for eighteen inches of insulation). “The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow.”
    
    You have a finite amount of willpower that becomes depleted as you use it.
    
    If you suddenly decide, for example, in the middle of a distracted afternoon spent web browsing, to switch your attention to a cognitively demanding task, 
    you’ll draw heavily from your finite willpower to wrest your attention away from the online shininess. Such attempts will therefore frequently fail.
    
    You could just try to make deep work a priority. But supporting this decision with the strategies that follow—or strategies of your own devising that are motivated by
     the same principles—will significantly increase the probability that you succeed in making deep work a crucial part of your professional life.
    
    You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify.
    
    You divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.
    
    The easiest way to consistently start deep work
    
     sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.
    
    Set starting time that you use every day for deep work.
    
    There is a popular notion that artists work from inspiration—that there is some strike or bolt or bubbling up of creative mojo from who knows where… but I hope [my work] 
    makes clear that waiting for inspiration to strike is a terrible, terrible plan. In fact, perhaps the single best piece of advice
     I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration.
    
    Where you’ll work and for how long. Your ritual needs to specify a location for your deep work efforts.
     This location can be as simple as your normal office with the door shut and desk cleaned off. Regardless of where you work, 
     be sure to also give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.
    
    How you’ll work once you start to work. Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structured. For example, you might institute a ban on any internet use, 
    or maintain a metric such as words produced per twenty-minute interval to keep your concentration honed. Without this structure, 
    you’ll have to mentally litigate again and again what you should and should not be doing during these sessions and keep trying to assess whether you’re working sufficiently hard.
     These are unnecessary drains on your willpower reserves.
    
    How you’ll support your work. Your ritual needs to ensure your brain gets the support it needs to keep operating at a high level of depth. 
    For example, the ritual might specify that you start with a cup of good coffee or make sure you have access to enough 
    food of the right type to maintain energy or integrate light exercise such as walking to help keep the mind clear. To maximize your success, 
    you need to support your efforts to go deep. At the same time, this support needs to be systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring out what you need in the moment.
    
    To put yourself in an exotic location to focus on a writing project, or to take a week off from work just to think, or to lock yourself in a hotel room 
    until you complete an important invention: These gestures push your deep goal to a level of mental priority that helps unlock the needed mental resources.
    Sometimes to go deep, you must first go big.
    
    A setup that straddles a spectrum where on one extreme we find the solo thinker, isolated from inspiration but free from distraction, and on the other extreme, 
    we find the fully collaborative thinker in an open office, flush with inspiration but struggling to support the deep thinking needed to build on it.
    
    Four “disciplines” (abbreviated, 4DX) for helping companies successfully implement high-level strategies.
    
    **Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important:**
    For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. 
    The general exhortation to “spend more time working deeply” doesn’t spark a lot of enthusiasm. 
    To instead have a specific goal that would return tangible and substantial professional benefits will generate a steadier stream of enthusiasm.
    
    **Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures:**
    Once you’ve identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. In 4DX, there are two types of metrics for this purpose:
     lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you’re ultimately trying to improve. For example, if your goal is to increase customer satisfaction in your bakery, 
     then the relevant lag measure is your customer satisfaction scores. As the 4DX authors explain, the problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior: “When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past.” Lead measures, on the other hand, “measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.” In the bakery example, a good lead measure might be the number of customers who receive free samples. This is a number you can directly increase by giving out more samples. As you increase this number, your lag measures will likely eventually improve as well. In other words, lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.
    
    **Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard:**
    “People play differently when they’re keeping score.” It’s important that they have a public place to record and track their lead measures. 
    This scoreboard creates a sense of competition that drives them to focus on these measures, even when other demands vie for their attention. 
    It also provides a reinforcing source of motivation. Once the team notices their success with a lead measure, they become invested in perpetuating this performance.
    
    **Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability:**
    The habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead (see Rule #4). During my experiments with 4DX,
     I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, 
     figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead. This led me to adjust my schedule to meet the needs of my lead measure — 
     enabling significantly more deep work than if I had avoided such reviews altogether.
    
    Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work. 
    When you work, work hard. When you’re done, be done.
    
    If every moment of potential boredom in your life —say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives—is relieved with a 
    quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the “mental wrecks” in Nass’s research, it’s not ready for deep work—even 
    if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration.
    
    Don’t Take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus.
    
    You should instead schedule the occasional break from focus to give in to distraction. Keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, 
    record the next time you’re allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed—no matter how tempting.
    
    If you’ve scheduled your next Internet block thirty minutes from the current moment, and you’re beginning to feel bored and crave distraction, 
    the next thirty minutes of resistance become a session of concentration calisthenics. A full day of scheduled distraction therefore becomes a full day of 
    similar mental training.
    
    Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use.
    
    Scheduling Internet use at home as well as at work can further improve your concentration training.
    
    To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn’t mean that you have to eliminate distracting 
    behaviors; it’s sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention.
    
    Concentration was so intense, and his reading so rapid, that he could afford more time off.
    
    In particular, identify a deep task (that is, something that requires deep work to complete) that’s high on your priority list. Estimate how long you’d 
    normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. Then motivate yourself by setting a 
    countdown timer on your phone and propping it up where you can’t avoid seeing it as you work.
    
    The more you practice resisting such urges, the
    
     easier such resistance becomes. After a few months of deploying this strategy, your understanding of what it means to focus will likely be transformed as 
     you reach levels of intensity stronger than anything you’ve experienced before.
    
    The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you’re occupied physically but not mentally—walking, jogging, driving, showering—and focus your 
    attention on a single well-defined professional problem.
    
    To succeed with productive meditation, it’s important to recognize that, like any form of meditation, it requires practice to do well.
    
    When you notice your attention slipping away from the problem at hand, gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later, then redirect your attention back.
    
    Try to picture the scene as clearly as possible - to memorization.
    
    White recommends that you begin by cementing in your mind the mental image of walking through five rooms in your home. Perhaps you come in the door, 
    walk through your front hallway, then turn into the downstairs bathroom, walk out the door and enter the guest bedroom, 
    walk into the kitchen, and then head down the stairs into your basement. In each room, conjure a clear image of what you see. 
    Once you can easily recall this mental walkthrough of a well-known location, fix in your mind a collection of ten items in each of these rooms. 
    White recommends that these items be large (and therefore more memorable), like a desk, not a pencil. Next, 
    establish an order in which you look at each of these items in each room. For example, in the front hallway, you might look at the entry mat, 
    then shoes on the floor by the mat, then the bench above the shoes, and so on. Combined this is only fifty items, so add two more items, perhaps in your backyard, 
    to get to the full fifty-two items you’ll later need when connecting these images to all the cards in a standard deck.
    
    To master the art of deep work, therefore, you must take back control of your time and attention from the many diversions that attempt to steal them.
    
    These services are engineered to be addictive—robbing time and attention from activities that more directly support your professional and personal goals 
    (such as deep work). Eventually, if you use these tools enough, you’ll arrive at the state of burned-out, hyper-distracted connectivity that plagued Baratunde 
    Thurston and millions of others like him.
    
    The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits.

    title: 'Do the work',
    body: `The following is a list of the forces arrayed against us as artists and entrepreneurs:**
    1. Resistance (i.e., fear, self-doubt, procrastination, addiction, distraction, timidity, ego and narcissism, self-loathing, perfectionism, etc.)
    2. Rational thought
    3. Friends and family
    
    **Resistance is a repelling force.** It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work.
    
    **The problem with friends and family** is that they know us as we are. They are invested in maintaining us as we are.
    
    **Once we commit to action,** the worst thing we can do is to stop.
    
    **The enemy is our chattering brain,** which, if we give it so much as a nanosecond, will start producing excuses, alibis, transparent self-justifications, 
    and a million reasons why we can’t/shouldn’t/won’t do what we know we need to do.
    
    **If you’re writing a movie, solve the climax first.** If you’re opening a restaurant, begin with the experience you want the diner to have when she walks in and enjoys a meal. 
    If you’re preparing a seduction, determine the state of mind you want the process of romancing to bring your lover to.
    
    **Figure out where you want to go;** then work backward from there.
    
    **One trick they use is to boil down their presentation to the following:**
    1. A killer opening scene
    2. Two major set pieces in the middle
    3. A killer climax
    4. A concise statement of the theme
    
    **Any project or enterprise can be broken down into beginning, middle, and end.** Fill in the gaps; then fill in the gaps between the gaps.
    
    **One rule for first full working drafts:** Get them done ASAP.
    
    **Ideas come according to their own logic.** That logic is not rational. It’s not linear. We may get the middle before we get the end. 
    We may get the end before we get the beginning. Be ready for this. Don’t resist it.
    
    **In writing, “action” means putting words on paper.** “Reflection” means evaluating what we have on paper.
    
    **How much time can you spare each day?** For that interval, close the door and—short of a family emergency or the outbreak of World War III—don’t let ANYBODY in. 
    Keep working. Keep working. Keep working.
    
    **There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us.** Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. 
    It saved my life, and it will save yours.
    
    **You can board a spaceship to Pluto and settle, all by yourself, into a perfect artist’s cottage ten zillion miles from Earth. Resistance will still be with you.** 
    The enemy is inside you.
    
    **The Enemy Is Inside You, But It Is Not You.** The fourth axiom of Resistance is that the enemy is inside you, but it is not you. 
    What does that mean? It means you are not to blame for the voices of Resistance you hear in your head. They are not your “fault.” You have done nothing “wrong.” 
    You have committed no “sin.” I have that same voice in my head. So
    
    **Resistance Arises Second.** The sixth principle of Resistance (and the key to overcoming it) is that Resistance arises second. What comes first is the idea, the passion, 
    the dream of the work we are so excited to create that it scares the hell out of us.
    
    **The dream is your project, your vision, your symphony, your startup.** The love is the passion and enthusiasm that fill your heart when you envision your project’s 
    completion.
    
    **Test Number One: “How bad do you want it?”**
    
    **Test Number Two: “Why do you want it?”**
    - To prove my old man (or ex-spouse, mother, teacher, coach) wrong.
    
    **The only items you get to keep are love for the work, will to finish, and passion to serve the ethical, creative Muse.**
    
    **The Big Crash is so predictable, across all fields of enterprise, that we can practically set our watches by it. Bank on it. It’s gonna happen.**
    
    **The worst part of the Big Crash is that nothing can prepare us for it.**
    
    **Because finishing is the critical part of any project.** If we can’t finish, all our work is for nothing.`
