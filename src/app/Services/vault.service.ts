      You can never predict what happens after you start a business. Long-term plans and detailed documents are pointless. Most businesses go on to do something very different from what they set out to do. Today, this is called a pivot.
  
      “A startup is a human institution designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.” Eric Ries
  
      A startup is a bit more exciting. It has:
      1. High impact potential.
      2. High levels of innovation.
      3. High levels of uncertainty
  
      I want you to think about launching a startup instead of a business. Anyone can create a job for themselves. But not everyone can change the world
  
      With high impact potential and high levels of innovation, a startup has the ability to change the world.
  
      Work on your business, not in your business—impossible and impractical when you are bootstrapping a new idea. Optimize your funnel—pointless when you have no leads. Hack your growth—difficult before you have customers.
  
      Execution is your ability to present your idea just as well as the best ideas in the world
  
      Hustle is relentlessly pursuing what needs to be done at the time
  
      Hustle for an early stage startup is generally about spending your time on the things that are most likely to bring you customers. That could mean “getting out of the building” for some. For you, your skillset, your customers, and your business, it might mean something totally different.
  
      “Move fast and break things.” Mark Zuckerberg
  
      Before you start a task, your brain visualizes the hardest parts to come. It then tries to simulate real work by focusing on small mindless tasks. In other words, you spend hours and days fussing over logos and website copy instead of selling your product
  
      A wantrepreneur is someone who wants to be an entrepreneur, but is so obsessed with watching TED talks and talking about their business ideas that they never launch them
  
      If you have a conversation with a friend about your business idea this month, and next month you are having the same conversation, you are a wantrepreneur
  
      “The world always seems brighter when you’ve just made something that wasn’t there before.” Neil Gaiman
  
      1. The Idea Matters - A bad idea, executed well, will not make a good business.
      2. Execution Matters - A good idea, executed poorly, will not make a good business.
      3. A Founder’s Ability to Get Customers (To Hustle) Matters - A great idea, executed well, will fail without customers.
      4. Timing Matters - Speaking hypothetically about an idea is pointless if the timing is wrong.
      5. Luck Matters - In fact, it matters much more than most entrepreneurs would care to admit.
  
      It makes no sense to start a business that is going to have you doing work you don’t enjoy. If you don’t like what you see, then it’s not a good business idea for you. Other than that, don’t worry about passion.
  
      Startup founders should have the ambition to grow their business into a larger company. If you don’t have that ambition, what you are creating is not a startup.
  
      Focusing on short-term launches or projects won’t build assets. Assets are built over time by ignoring short-term distractions in favor of a bigger, longterm vision.
  
      A list of customers that pay you every month is an asset. If you focus on shortterm projects you’ll make more money initially. But if you turn down projects and focus on providing recurring value, you build a valuable asset. Your product design and intellectual property are assets. If you resell or copy someone else’s product, you might have better margins in the short term; but creating your own gives you a long-term asset. Your team is an asset. If you hire mediocre people to save money, you get more money in the short term. If you hire great people, you are building a valuable asset that grows your business.
  
      Creating a startup means creating something valuable for your customers that is a long-term asset. It doesn’t mean going after low-hanging fruit, getting caught up in get rich quick schemes, or chasing passive income fundamentally entrepreneurship is about creating a product that people want and selling it to them.
  
      “People don’t know what they want until you show it to them,” is correct. Everyone might be saying that your idea is great, but look at whether or not they are currently paying for a solution to the same problem.
  
      Write down exactly what you will launch on Day 7. What will your customers get, what is included, and what is excluded? If necessary, write down what is automated and what will be done manually in the short term.
  
      Day 1 Task - Brainstorm a bunch of ideas and evaluate them against the checklist. Choose the idea that stands out as being the best option for you. You can use the template provided at wpcurve.com/7daystartup if that helps. Most importantly, keep your name to fewer than 12 characters if possible.
  
      Create in-depth content based around the customer problems that your business solves.
      2. Make content as actionable and useful to your target audience as possible.
      3. It can’t be boring. Don’t just create content around your area of expertise. Create anything that is interesting to your potential customers
  
      Getting press attention for your company can be a huge bonus. If it’s well targeted, it leads to direct customers. Perhaps a bigger benefit is the extra proof and credibility you get as a result
  
      Marketing is really just about getting your message out to qualified people as efficiently as possible. Connect your message with them as best you can
  
      Day 5 Task - Build a list of what marketing methods you are going to choose. Put together a rough plan for the first week or two of your launch. To make it easier, Save your excitement until you land people you don’t know as customers.
  
      Create a spreadsheet that covers the first few months in business, the number of signups, revenue, estimated costs, and monthly growth
  
      “If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late.” Reid Hoffman
  
      Day 7 Task - Launch and start executing your marketing plan.
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      What are you working on today that will make you indestructible tomorrow?
  
      If you have an open mind, you can easily test your assumptions and those assumptions made by others in your industry. Why does everyone in your industry do things a certain way? What do your customers really like about your service? Why aren’t people buying your product? Why are they buying your product? Are people using your product? How are they using it? Why do they love it?
  
      What do they tell people when they refer you? Are certain parts of your product necessary? Do you need an office? Do you need a business card? Do you need a logo
  
      Being true to your word is a very important part of building trust in business. Whether you are offering services or selling a product, make sure you always deliver on what you promise. You can do everything else right, but if you are the guy or girl that promises the world and doesn’t deliver, your mistake will be uncovered in the end. Your reputation is everything and it will impact every business you start, not just this one. It’s far better to under-promise and over-deliver, or at the very least deliver exactly what you promise every time.
  
      Don’t debate every last issue internally until you are blue in the face. Whatever you are discussing can probably be solved by either looking at what other companies have done before you, or implementing a quick decision and learning from the real data. The minutiae that you are debating could be distracting you from a fundamental problem that you aren’t seeing. Always take a step back and ask yourself if it’s feasible that someone else may have solved this problem before
  
      “Startups exist not just to make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. They exist to learn how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision.”
  
      Eric Ries calls it “Build, Measure, Learn.” Michael Masterson calls it “Ready Fire Aim.” I call it “Getting Shit Done.”
  
      Your own personal happiness and motivation are the most important keys to the success of your business. I know plenty of people who have created great businesses, taken them to a point, and then lost all motivation. If you are struggling with motivation, join a forum, start a mastermind, find a cofounder, hire people to do the hard work, and get back to what you’re good at. Take the warning signs seriously. You should be more excited about Monday than you are about Friday. If that’s not the case, there’s a good chance things aren’t going to work out
  
      Difficult customers will waste your time, kill your confidence, and destroy your motivation (and soul). No amount of money is worth working with a difficult customer. Every difficult customer can be replaced by a better one, generally much quicker than you think. The work required to replace them is a far better use of your time than any work spent trying to help them
  
      Think in the long term about what asset you are building as a result of actions you complete today. Getting carried away on short-term projects will kill any chance of momentum and hurt growth
  
      Running a business can be daunting. Every expert has a different opinion on some “must have” technique or technology you need to be using. It’s hard to know where to spend your time, money, and attention. If you are in doubt, come back to the product. Anything you can do that improves the product or improves the customer experience will be a sound investment.
  
      14. Love Your Work If you don’t, the rest will fall apart. It’s that simple
  
      “The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.” Eric Ries Hopefully I’ve set you on a path to create an exciting and profitable startup. The first major hurdle is launching; then, getting your first customer; and then, proving the concept and generating a wage for yourself in a scalable way. What happens after all that? Now it’s time to run your business, and your decisions from here out will make or break it in the long term. Most businesses don’t survive, so what do you do to keep yours growing?
